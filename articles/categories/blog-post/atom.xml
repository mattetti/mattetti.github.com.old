    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most modern web applications start as a monolithic code base and, as complexity increases, the once small app gets split apart into many "modules". In other cases, engineers opt for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA</a> design approach from the beginning. One way or another, we start running multiple separate applications that need to interact seamlessly. My goal will be to describe some of the high-level challenges and solutions found in implementing a Single-Sign-On service.</p>

<h2>Authentication vs Authorization</h2>

<p>I wish these two words didn't share the same root because it surely confuses a lot of people. My most frequently-discussed example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>. Every time I start talking about implementing a centralized/unified authentication system, someone jumps in and suggests that we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>. The challenge is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a> is an authorization system, not an authentication system.</p>

<p>It's tricky, because you might actually be "authenticating" yourself to website X using OAuth. What you are really doing is allowing website X to use your information stored by the OAuth provider. It is true that OAuth offers a pseudo-authentication approach via its provider but that is not the main goal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>: the Auth in OAuth stands for Authorization, not Authentication.</p>

<p>Here is how we could briefly describe each role:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authentication</strong>: recognizes who you are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authorization</strong>: know what you are allowed to do, or what you allow others to do.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you are feel stuck in your design and something seems wrong, ask yourself if you might be confused by the 2 auth words. This article will only focus on <strong>authentication</strong>.</p>

<h2>A Common Scenario</h2>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-simplescenario.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-simplescenario.png" alt="SSO diagram with 3 top applications connecting to an authorization service." /></a></p>

<p>This is probably the most common structure, though I made it slightly more complex by drawing the three main apps in different programming languages. We have three web applications running on different subdomains and sharing account data via a centralized authentication service.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep authentication and basic account data isolated.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow users to stay logged in while browsing different apps.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Implementing such a system should be easy. That said, if you migrate an existing app to an architecture like that, you will spend 80% of your time decoupling your legacy code from authentication and wondering what data should be centralized and what should be distributed. Unfortunately, I can't tell you what to do there since this is very domain specific. Instead, let's see how to do the "easy part."</p>

<h2>Centralizing and Isolating Shared Account Data</h2>

<p>At this point, you more than likely have each of your apps talk directly to shared database tables that contain user account data. The first step is to migrate away from doing that. We need a single interface that is the only entry point to create or update shared account data. Some of the data we have in the database might be app specific and therefore should stay within each app, anything that is shared across apps should be moved behind the new interface.</p>

<p>Often your centralized authentication system will store the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ID</p></li>
<li><p>first name</p></li>
<li><p>last name</p></li>
<li><p>login/nickname</p></li>
<li><p>email</p></li>
<li><p>hashed password</p></li>
<li><p>salt</p></li>
<li><p>creation timestamp</p></li>
<li><p>update timestamp</p></li>
<li><p>account state (verified, disabled ...)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Do not duplicate this data in each app, instead have each app rely on the account ID to query data that is specific to a given account in the app. Technically that means that instead of using SQL joins, you will query your database using the ID as part of the condition.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to do things slowly but surely. Migrate your database schema piece by piece assuring that everything works fine. Once the other pieces will be in place, you can migrate one code API a time until your entire code base is moved over. You might want to change your DB credentials to only have read access, then no access at all.</p>

<h2>Login workflow</h2>

<p>Each of our apps already has a way for users to login. We don't want to change the user experience, instead we want to make a transparent modification so the authentication check is done in a centralized way instead of a local way. To do that, the easiest way is to keep your current login forms but instead of POSTing them to your local apps, we'll POST them to a centralized authentication API. (SSL is strongly recommended)</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login.png" alt="diagram showing the login workflow" /></a></p>

<p>As shown above, the login form now submits to an endpoint in the authentication application. The form will more than likely include a login or email and a clear text password as well as a hidden callback/redirect url so that the authentication API can redirect the user's browser to the original app. For security reasons, you might want to white list the domains you allow your authentication app to redirect to.</p>

<p>Internally, the Authentication app will validate the identifier (email or login) using a hashed version of the clear password against the matching record in the account data. If the verification is successful, a token will be generated containing some user data (for instance: id, first name, last name, email, created date, authentication timestamp). If the verification failed, the token isn't generated. Finally the user's browser is redirected to the callback/redirect URL provided in the request with the token being passed.</p>

<p>You might want to safely encrypt the data in a way that allows the clients to verify and trust that the token comes from a trusted source. A great solution for that would be to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm">RSA encryption</a>) with the public key available in all your client apps but the private key only available on the auth server(s). Other strong encryption solutions would also work. For instance, another appropriate approach would be to add a signature to the params sent back. This way the clients could check the authenticity of the params. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a> signature are great for that but in some cases, you don't want people to see the content of the data you send back. That's especially true if you are sending back a 'mobile' token for instance. But that's a different story. What's important to consider is that we need a way to ensure that the data sent back to the client can't be tampered with. You might also make sure you prevent replay attacks.</p>

<p>On the other side, the application receives a GET request with a token param. If the token is empty or can't be decrypted, authentication failed. At that point, we need to show the user the login page again and let him/her try again. If on the other hand, the token can be decrypted, the content should be saved in the session so future requests can reuse the data.</p>

<p>We described the authentication workflow, but if a user logins in application X, (s)he won't be logged-in in application Y or Z. The trick here, is to set a top level domain cookie that can be seen by all applications running on subdomains. Certainly, this solution only works for apps being on the same domain, but we'll see later how to handle apps on different domains.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login-cookie.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login-cookie.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The cookie doesn't need to contain a lot of data, its value can contain the account id, a timestamp (to know when authentication happened and a trusted signature) and a signature. The signature is critical here since this cookie will allow users to be automatically logged in other sites. I'd recommend the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a> encryptions to generate the signature. The DSA encryption, very much like the RSA encryption is an asymmetrical encryption relying on a public/private key. This approach offers more security than having something based a shared secret like HMAC does. But that's really up to you.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to set a filter in your application. This auto-login filter will check the presence of an auth cookie on the top level domain and the absence of local session. If that's the case, a session is automatically created using the user id from the cookie value after the cookie integrity is verified. We could also share the session between all our apps, but in most cases, the data stored by each app is very specific and it's safer/cleaner to keep the sessions isolated. The integration with an app running on a different service will also be easier if the sessions are isolated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>For registration, as for login, we can take one of two approaches: point the user's browser to the auth API or make S2S (server to server) calls from within our apps to the Authentication app. POSTing a form directly to the API is a great way to reduce duplicated logic and traffic on each client app so I'll demonstrate this approach.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CopyofSSO-register.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CopyofSSO-register.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the approach is the same we used to login. The difference is that instead of returning a token, we just return some params (id, email and potential errors). The redirect/callback url will also obviously be different than for login. You could decide to encrypt the data you send back, but in this scenario, what I would do is set an auth cookie at the .domain.com level when the account is created so the "client" application can auto-login the user. The information sent back in the redirect is used to re-display the register form with the error information and the email entered by the user.</p>

<p>At this point, our implementation is almost complete. We can create an account and login using the defined credentials. Users can switch from one app to another without having to re login because we are using a shared signed cookie that can only be created by the authentication app and can be verified by all "client" apps. Our code is simple, safe and efficient.</p>

<h2>Updating or deleting an account</h2>

<p>The next thing we will need is to update or delete an account. In this case, this is something that needs to be done between a "client" app and the authentication/accounts app. We'll make S2S (server to server) calls. To ensure the security of our apps and to offer a nice way to log requests, API tokens/keys will be used by each client to communicate with the authentication/accounts app. The API key can be passed using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">X-header</a> so this concern stays out of the request params and our code can process separately the authentication via X-header and the actual service implementation. S2S services should have a filter verifying and logging the API requests based on the key sent with the request. The rest is straight forward.</p>

<h2>Using different domains</h2>

<p>Until now, we assumed all our apps were on the same top domain. In reality, you will often find yourself with apps on different domains. This means that you can't use the shared signed cookie approach anymore. However, there is a simple trick that will allow you to avoid requiring your users to re-login as they switch apps.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-differentdomains-1.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-differentdomains-1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The trick consists, when a local session isn't present, of using an iframe in the application using the different domain. The iframe loads a page from the authentication/accounts app which verifies that a valid cookie was set on the main top domain. If that is the case, we can tell the application that the user is already globally logged in and we can tell the iframe host to redirect to an application end point passing an auth token the same way we did during the authentication. The app would then create a session and redirect the user back to where (s)he started. The next requests will see the local session and this process will be ignored.</p>

<p>If the authentication application doesn't find a signed cookie, the iframe can display a login form or redirect the iframe host to a login form depending on the required behavior.</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind when using multiple apps and domains is that you need to keep the shared cookies/sessions in sync, meaning that if you log out from an app, you need to also delete the auth cookie to ensure that users are globally logged out. (It also means that you might always want to use an iframe to check the login status and auto-logoff users).</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Mobile clients</h2>

<p>Another part of implementing a SSO solution is to handle mobile clients. Mobile clients need to be able to register/login and update accounts. However, unlike S2S service clients, mobile clients should only allow calls to modify data on the behalf of a given user. To do that, I recommend providing opaque mobile tokens during the login process. This token can then be sent with each request in a X-header so the service can authenticate the user making the request. Again, SSL is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>In this approach, we don't use a cookie and we actually don't need a SSO solution, but an unified authentication system.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Writing web services</h2>

<p>Our Authentication/Accounts application turns out to be a pure web API app.</p>

<p>We also have 3 sets of APIs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public APIs: can be accessed from anywhere, no authentication required</p></li>
<li><p>S2S APIs: authenticated via API keys and only available to trusted clients</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile APIs: authenticated via a mobile token and limited in scope.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We don't need dynamic HTML views, just simple web service related code. While this is a little bit off topic, I'd like to take a minute to show you how I personally like writing web service applications.</p>

<p>Something that I care a lot about when I implement web APIs is to validate incoming params. This is an opinionated approach that I picked up while at Sony and that I think should be used every time you implement a web API. As a matter of fact, I wrote a Ruby <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/Weasel-Diesel">DSL library (Weasel Diesel)</a> allowing you <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/blob/master/api/hello_world.rb">describe a given service</a>, its <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/blob/master/api/hello_world.rb#L7">incoming params</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/blob/master/api/hello_world.rb#L10-15">expected output</a>. This DSL is hooked into a web backend so you can implement services using a web engine such as <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> or maybe Rails3. Based on the DSL usage, incoming parameters are be verified before being processed. The other advantage is that you can generate documentation based on the API description as well as automated tests.</p>

<p>You might be familiar with <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, another DSL for web services. Besides the obvious style difference <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/Weasel-Diesel">Weasel Diesel </a>offers the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>input validation/sanitization</p></li>
<li><p>service isolation</p></li>
<li><p>generated documentation</p></li>
<li><p>contract based design</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a hello world webservice being implemented using Weasel Diesel and Sinatra:</p>

<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/2300131[/gist]</p>

<p>Basis test validating the contract defined in the DSL and the actual output when the service is called:</p>

<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/2300440[/gist]</p>

<p>Generated documentation:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120404-t1j93b73tef5pmd5idfqqa61td.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the DSL and its features seem appealing to you and you are interested in digging more into it, the easiest way is to fork <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/">this demo repo</a> and start writing your own services.</p>

<p>The DSL has been used in production for more than a year, but there certainly are tweaks and small changes that can make the user experience even better. Feel free to fork the <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/Weasel-Diesel">DSL repo</a> and send me Pull Requests.</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2012/02/29/learning-from-rails-failures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ruby on Rails undisputedly changed the way web frameworks are designed. Rails became a reference when it comes to leveraging conventions, easy baked in feature set and a rich ecosystem. However, I think that Rails did and still does a lot of things pretty poorly.  By writing this post, I'm not trying to denigrate Rails, there are many other people out there already doing that. My hope is that by listing what I think didn't and still doesn't go well, we can learn from our mistakes and improve existing solutions or create better new ones.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/2012/02/29/learning-from-rails-failures/train_fail/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/train_fail-300x188.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2>Migration/upgrades</h2>

<p>Migrating a Rails App from a version to the other is very much like playing the lottery, you are almost sure you will lose. To be more correct, you know things will break, you just don't know what, when and how. The Rails team seems to think that everybody is always running on the cutting edge version and don't consider people who prefer to stay a few version behind for stability reasons. What's worse is that plugins/gems might or might not compatible with the version you are updating to, but you will only know that by trying yourself and letting others try and report potential issues.</p>

<p>This is for me, by far, the biggest issue with Rails and something that should have been fixed a long time ago. If you're using the WordPress blog engine, you know how easy and safe it is to upgrade the engine or the plugins. Granted WordPress isn't a web dev framework, but it gives you an idea of what kind of experience we should be striving for.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Stability vs playground zone</h2>

<p>New features are cool and they help make the platform more appealing to new comers. They also help shape the future of a framework. But from my perspective, that shouldn't come to the cost of stability. Rails 3's new asset pipeline is a good example of a half-baked solution shoved in a release at the last minute and creating a nightmare for a lot of us trying to upgrade. I know, I know, you can turn off the asset pipeline and it got better since it was first released. But shouldn't that be the other way around? Shouldn't fun new ideas risking the stability of an app or making migration harder, be off by default and turned on only by people wanting to experiment? When your framework is young, it's normal that you move fast and sometimes break, but once it matures, these things shouldn't happen.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Public/private/plugin APIs</h2>

<p>This is more of a recommendation than anything else. When you write a framework in a very dynamic language like Ruby, people will "monkey patch" your code to inject features. Sometimes it is due to software design challenges, sometimes it's because people don't know better. However,  by not explicitly specifying what APIs are private (they can change at anytime, don't touch), what APIs are public (stable, will be slowly deprecated when they need to be changed) and which ones are for plugin devs only (APIs meant for instrumentation, extension etc..), you are making migration to newer versions much harder. You see, if you have a small, clean public API, then it's easy to see what could break, warn developers and avoid migration nightmares. However, you need to start doing that early on in your project, otherwise you will end up like Rails where all code can potentially change anytime.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Rails/Merb merge was a mistake</h2>

<p>This is my personal opinion and well, feel free to disagree, nobody will ever be able to know to for sure. Without explaining what happened behind closed doors and the various personal motivations, looking at the end result, I agree with the group of people thinking that the merge didn't turn up to be a good thing. For me, Rails 3 isn't significantly better than Rails 2 and it took forever to be released. You still can't really run a mini Rails stack like promised. I did hear that Strobe (company who was hiring Carl Lerche, Yehuda Katz and contracted Jose Valim) used to have an ActionPack based, mini stack but it was never released and apparently only Rails core members really knew what was going on there. Performance in vanilla Rails 3 are only now getting close to what you had with Rails 2 (and therefore far from the perf you were getting with Merb). Thread-safety is still OFF by default meaning that by default your app uses a giant lock only allowing a process to handle 1 request at a time. For me, the flexibility and performance focus of Merb were mainly lost in the merge with Rails. (Granted, some important things such as ActiveModel, cleaner internals and others have made their way into Rails 3)</p>

<p>But what's worse than everything listed so far is that the lack of competition and the internal rewrites made Rails lose its headstart.  Rails is very much HTML/view focused, its primarily strength is to make server side views trivial and it does an amazing job at that. But let's be honest, that's not the future for web dev. The future is more and more logic pushed to run on the client side (in JS) and the server side being used as an API serving data for the view layer. I'm sorry but adding support for CoffeeScript doesn't really do much to making Rails evolve ahead of what it currently is. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of CoffeeScript, that said I still find that Rails is far from being optimized to developer web APIs in Rails. You can certainly do it, but you are basically using a tool that wasn't designed to write APIs and you pay the overhead for that. If there is one thing I wish Rails will get better at is to make writing pure web APIs better (thankfully there is Sinatra). But at the end of the day, I think that two projects with different philosophies and different approaches are really hard to merge, especially in the open source world. I wouldn't go as far as saying like others that Rails lost its sexiness to node.js because of the wasted time, but I do think that things would have been better for all if that didn't happen. However, I also have to admit that I'm not sure how much of a big deal that is. I prefer to leave the past behind, learn from my own mistake and move on.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Technical debts</h2>

<p>Here I'd like to stop to give a huge props to Aaron "<a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a>" Patterson, the man who's actively working to reduce the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debts</a> in the Rails code base. This is a really hard job and definitely not a very glamorous one. He's been working on various parts of Rails including its router and its ORM (ActiveRecord). Technical debts are unfortunately normal in most project, but sometimes they are overwhelming to the point that nobody dares touching the code base to clean it up. This is a hard problem, especially when projects move fast like Rails did. But looking back, I think that you want to start tackling technical debts on the side as you move on so you avoid getting to the point that you need a hero to come up and clean the piled errors made in the past. But don't pause your entire project to clean things up otherwise you will lose market, momentum and excitement. I feel that this is also very much true for any legacy project you might pick up as a developer.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Keep the cost of entry level low</h2>

<p>Getting started with Rails used to be easier. This can obviously argued since it's very subjective, but from my perspective I think we forgot where we come from and we involuntary expect new comers to come with unrealistic knowledge. Sure, Rails does much more than it used to do, but it's also much harder to get started. I'm not going to argue how harder  it is now or why we got there. Let's just keep in mind that it is a critical thing that should always be re-evaluated. Sure, it's harder when you have an open source project, but it's also up to the leadership to show that they care and to encourage and mentor volunteers to  focus on this important part of a project.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Rails documentation isn't bad, but it's far from being great. Documentation certainly isn't one of the Ruby's community strength, especially compared with the Python community, but what saddens me is to see the state of <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">the official documentation</a> which, should, in theory be the reference. Note that the Rails guides are usually well written and provide value, but they too often seem too light and not useful when you try to do something not totally basic (for instance use an ActiveModel compliant object). That's probably why most people don't refer to them or don't spend too much time there. I'm not trying to blame anyone there. I think that the people who contributed theses guides did an amazing job, but if you want to build a strong and easy to access community, great documentation is key. Look at the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/">Django</a> documentation as a good example. That said, I also need to acknowledge the amazing job done by many community members such as <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Ryan Bates</a> and <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl</a> consistently providing high value external documentation via the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">railscasts</a> and the intro to <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Rails tutorial</a> available for free.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In conclusion, I think that there is a lot to learn from Rails, lots of great things as well as lots of things you would want to avoid. We can certainly argue on Hacker News or via comments about whether or not I'm right about Rails failures, my point will still be that the mentioned issues should be avoided in any projects, Rails here is just an example. Many of these issues are currently being addressed by the Rails team but wouldn't it be great if new projects learn from older ones and avoid making the same mistakes? So what other mistakes do you think I forgot to mention and that one should be very careful of avoiding?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I did some quick digging into how ORM objects are initialized and the performance cost associated to that. In other words, I wanted to see what's going on when you initialize an ActiveRecord object.</p>

<p>Before I show you the benchmark numbers and you jump to conclusions, it's important to realize that in the grand scheme of things, the performance cost we are talking is small enough that it is certainly not the main reason why your application is slow. Spoiler alert: ActiveRecord is slow but the cost of initialization isn't by far the worse part of ActiveRecord. Also, even though this article doesn't make activeRecord look good, and I'm not trying to diss it. It's a decent ORM that does a great job in most cases.</p>

<p>Let's get started by the benchmarks number to give us an idea of the damage (using Ruby 1.9.3 p125):</p>

<p> </p>

<pre><code>                                                             | Class | Hash  | AR 3.2.1 | AR no protection | Datamapper | Sequel |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.new() x100000                                               | 0.037 | 0.049 | 1.557    | 1.536            | 0.027      | 0.209  |
.new({:id=&gt;1, :title=&gt;"Foo", :text=&gt;"Bar"}) x100000          | 0.327 | 0.038 | 6.784    | 5.972            | 4.226      | 1.986  |
</code></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>You can see that I am comparing the allocation of a Class instance, a Hash and some ORM models. The benchmark suite tests the allocation of an empty object and one with passed attributes. The benchmark in question is available <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/init_objects.rb">here</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see there seems to be a huge performance difference between allocating a basic class and an ORM class. Instantiating an ActiveRecord class is 20x slower than instantiating a normal class, while ActiveRecord offers some extra features, why is it so much slower, especially at initialization time?</p>

<p>The best way to figure it out is to profile the initialization. For that, I used <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb">perftools.rb</a> and I generated a graph of the call stack.</p>

<p>Here is what Ruby does (and spends its time) when you initialize a new Model instance (click to download the PDF version):</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_init_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AR-model-instantation-by-Matt-Aimonetti.jpg" alt="Profiler diagram of AR model instantiation by Matt Aimonetti" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is quite a scary graph but it shows nicely the features you are getting and their cost associated. For instance, the option of having the before and after initialization callback cost you 14% of your CPU time per instantiation, even though you probably almost never use these callbacks. I'm reading that by interpreting the node called ActiveSupport::Callback#run_callbacks, 3rd level from the top. So 14.1% of the CPU time is spent trying to run callbacks. As a quick note, note that 90.1% of the CPU time is spent initializing objects, the rest is spent in the loop and in the garbage collection (because the profiler runs many loops). You can then follow the code and see how the code works, creating a dynamic class callback method on the fly (the one with the long name) and then recreating the name of this callback to call it each time the object is allocated. It sounds like that's a good place for some micro optimizations which could yield up to 14% performance increase in some cases.</p>

<p>Another major part of the CPU time is spent in ActiveModel's sanitization. This is the piece of code that allows you to block some model attributes to be mass assigned. This is useful when you don't want to sanitize your incoming params but want to create or update a model instance by using all the passed user params. To avoid malicious users to modify some specific params that might be in your model but not in your form, you can protect these attributes. A good example would be an admin flag on a User object. That said, if you manually initialize an instance, you don't need this extra protection, that's why in the benchmark above, I tested and without the protection. As you can see, it makes quite a big difference. The profiler graph of the same initialization without the mass assignment protection logically ends up looking quite different:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/glv">Glenn Vanderburg</a> pointed out that some people might assuming that the shown code path is called for each record loaded from the database. This isn't correct, the graph represents instances allocated by calling #new. See the addition at the bottom of the post for more details about what's going on when you fetch data from the DB.</p>

<p>I then decided to look at the graphs for the two other popular Ruby ORMs:</p>

<p><a href="http://datamapper.org/">Datamapper</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/dm_init_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120223-txs4wa7b5rdpg45aj6354xg1wt.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>and <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/sequel_init_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120223-p2jx6ypk35ucsgtx7p1tcabpes.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>While I didn't give you much insight in ORM code, I hope that this post will motivate you to sometimes take a look under the cover and profile your code to see what's going on and why it might be slow. <strong>Never assume, always measure</strong>. Tools such as perftools are a great way to get a visual feedback and get a better understanding of how the Ruby interpreter is handling your code.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>I heard you liked graphs so I added some more, here is what's going on when you do Model.first:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_first_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120224-f23s8xctghi8mj6ax3cdw9aq25.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Model.all</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_all_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120224-q29q4n7bj3i96erk1enxdqxb5e.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>And finally this is the code graph for a call to Model.instantiate which is called after a record was retrieved from the database to convert into an Object. (You can see the #instantiate call referenced in the graph above).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_instantiate_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120224-8scmun9n1c9ufdnxa8rq2961bq.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

    <updated>2011-12-21T06:57:27+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/12/21/developing-a-curriculum</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I asked a friend of mine to give me pointers on how to develop a curriculum (he used to teach an education PHD program), after discussing his response on Twitter, people asked me to put it somewhere, so here it is:</p>

<p>Process to develop a curriculum:</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>. <em>Know why you're doing what you're doing.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You know how to do this.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Product</strong>. <em>Start with the end in mind.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What does the student look like when they walk out the door at the end of the training.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, we break these down into <strong>Knowledge</strong>, <strong>Skills</strong>, or <strong>Attitudes</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes it's helpful to see a photograph or drawing of a someone who finished the program and just talk about what they can do that makes them successful.</p></li>
<li><p>This "product" should be connected and help you accomplish your mission</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Practices</strong>. <em>Then ask yourself, "How do people become like this?"</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you can break down your Product into 3-5 bit-sized chunks, then see how people learn each one of those skills, gain each one of those knowledge points, and how to they gain the attitudes you want them to have.</p></li>
<li><p>This one is much easier the more experience you have in seeing people develop the "Product."</p></li>
<li><p>This is also easier to determine when you understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_theory_(education">Learning Theory</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The results from this section will result in a list of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>       Activities or experiences</p></li>
<li><p>       Resources. What books, website, teachers, software, etc. will help them learn more effectively and efficiently</p></li>
<li><p>       Assessments. How you would know if the activity was helpful?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Plans</strong>. <em>Make your plans based on the practices you've determined you've needed.</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>On a related topic, Chad Fowler posted an interesting <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2011/12/21/re-thinking-software-development-education">blog post about what LivingSocial is doing to change the software development education</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/10/18/data-safety-and-gil-removal/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-18T15:19:17+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/10/18/data-safety-and-gil-removal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After my recent <a href="http://rubyconf11.merbist.com">RubyConf talk</a> and <a href="http://merbist.com/2011/10/03/about-concurrency-and-the-gil/">follow up post addressing the Ruby &amp; Python's Global Interpreter Lock</a> (aka GVL/Global VM Lock). a lot of people asked me to explain what I meant by "data safety". While my point isn't to defend one approach or the other, I spent a lot of time explaining why C Ruby and C Python use a GIL and where it matters and where it matters less. As a reminder and as mentioned by Matz himself, the main reason why C Ruby still has a GIL is data safety. But if this point isn't clear to you, you might be missing the main argument supporting the use of a GIL.</p>

<p>Showing obvious concrete examples of data corruption due to unsafe threaded code isn't actually as easy at it sounds. First of all, even with a GIL, developers can write unsafe threaded code. So we need to focus only on the safety problems raised by removing the GIL. To demonstrate what I mean, I will try to create some race conditions and show you the unexpected results you might get. Again, before you go crazy on the comments, remember that threaded code is indeterministic and the code below might potentially work on your machine and that's exactly why it is hard to demonstrate. Race conditions depend on many things, but in this case I will focus on race conditions affecting basic data structures since it might be the most surprising.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<pre><code>@array, threads = [], []
4.times do
  threads &lt;&lt; Thread.new { (1..100_000).each {|n| @array &lt;&lt; n} }
end
threads.each{|t| t.join }
puts @array.size
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, I'm creating an instance variable of Array type and I start 4 threads. Each of these threads adds 100,000 items to the array. We then wait for all the threads to be done and check the size of the array.</p>

<p>If you run this code in C Ruby the end result will be as expected:</p>

<pre><code>400000
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you switch to JRuby you might be surprised by the output. If you are lucky you will see the following:</p>

<pre><code>ConcurrencyError: Detected invalid array contents due to unsynchronized modifications with concurrent users

</code></pre>

<p>This is actually a good thing. JRuby detects that you are unsafely modifying an instance variable across threads and that data corruption will occur. However, the exception doesn't always get raised and you will potentially see results such as:</p>

<pre><code>335467
342397
341080
</code></pre>

<p>This is a sign that the data was corrupted but that JRuby didn't catch the unsynchronized modification. On the other hand MacRuby and Rubinius 2 (dev) won't raise any exceptions and will just corrupt the data, outputting something like:</p>

<pre><code>294278
285755
280704
279865
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, if not manually synchronized, shared data can easily be corrupted. You might have two threads modifying the value of the same variable and one of the two threads will step on top of the other leaving you with a race condition. You only need 2 threads accessing the same instance variable at the same time to get a race condition. My example uses more threads and more mutations to make the problem more obvious. Note that TDD wouldn't catch such an issue and even extensive testing will provide very little guarantee that your code is thread safe.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>So what? Thread safety isn't a new problem.</h2>

<p>That's absolutely correct, ask any decent Java developer out there, he/she will tell how locks are used to "easily" synchronize objects to make your code thread safe. They might also mention the deadlocks and other issues related to that, but that's a different story. One might also argue that when you write web apps, there is very little shared data and the chances of corrupting data across concurrent requests is very small since most of the data is kept in a shared data store outside of the process.</p>

<p>All these arguments are absolutely valid, the challenge is that you have a large community and a large amount of code out there that expects a certain behavior. And removing the GIL does change this behavior. It might not be a big deal for you because you know how to deal with thread safety, but it might be a big deal for others and C Ruby is by far the most used Ruby implementation. It's basically like saying that automatic cars shouldn't be made and sold, and everybody has to switch to stick shifts. They have better gas mileage, I personally enjoy driving then and they are cheaper to build. Removing the GIL is a bit like that. There is a cost associated with this decision and while this cost isn't insane, the people in charge prefer to not pay it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Screw that, I'll switch to Node.js</h2>

<p>I heard a lot of people telling me they were looking into using Node.js because it has a better design and no GIL. While I like Node.js and if I were to implement a chat room or an app keeping connections for a long time, I would certainly compare it closely to EventMachine, I also think that this argument related to the GIL is absurd. First, you have other Ruby implementations which don't have a GIL and are really stable (i.e: JRuby) but then Node basically works the same as Ruby with a GIL. Yes, Node is evented and single threaded but when you think about it, it behaves the same as Ruby 1.9 with its GIL. Many requests come in and they are handled one after the other and because IO requests are non-blocking, multiple requests can be processed concurrently but not in parallel. Well folks, that's exactly how C Ruby works too, and unlike popular believe, most if not all the popular libraries making IO requests are non blocking (when using 1.9). So, next time you try to justify you wanting to toy with Node, please don't use the GIL argument.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>What should I do?</h2>

<p>As always, evaluate your needs and see what makes sense for your project. Start by making sure you are using Ruby 1.9 and your code makes good use of threading. Then look at your app and how it behaves, is it CPU-bound or IO-bound. Most web apps out there are IO-bound (waiting for the DB, redis or API calls), and when doing an IO call, Ruby's GIL is released allowing another thread to do its work. In that case, not having a GIL in your Ruby implementation won't help you. However, if your app is CPU-bound, then switching to JRuby or Rubinius might be beneficial. However, don't assume anything until you proved it and remember that making such a change will more than likely require some architectural redesign, especially if using JRuby.  But, hey, it might totally be worth it as many proved it in the past.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I hope I was able to clarify things a bit further. If you wish to dig further, I would highly recommend you read the many discussions the Python community had in the last few years.</p>

    <updated>2011-10-11T22:53:40+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/10/11/about-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to save myself a session to the shrink and instead just write down my reflection on management. Who knows, some of you might help me and/or challenge my thought process.</p>

<p>I recently read a great management book called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UCUX0K/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=merbist-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B000UCUX0K&amp;adid=0BP6N5GHZD0EW2N7QVZR&amp;">five dysfunctions of a team by Patrick Lencioni</a> . Instead of telling you what to do, the author highlights behavior patterns that are related to each other and when aggregated result in dysfunctional teams. I really liked the book because instead of a being a cookbook/playbook, this is more a fail book, in other words, it illustrates what you don't want to do and explains why. It highlights very well the relation between various behaviors and nicely illustrates why teams of brilliant people can fail. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UCUX0K/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=merbist-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B000UCUX0K&amp;adid=0BP6N5GHZD0EW2N7QVZR&amp;">Kindle version is at less than $5, go get it</a> and read it on your iPhone/iPad/computer/browser…</p>

<p>So this book somewhat changed my perception of management and leadership. Interesting enough, at Sony, my previous employer, they make a distinction between management and leadership. While they hope managers can be leaders, they don't require them to be and to be honest very few are. I'm not sure that's a good or a bad things, but I, for sure, was under different expectations. Finally, I spent a large amount of my life on the internet working on/with projects where meritocracy, respect and honor were key. The "ranking" is purely based on what your peers think of you and not based on your age/sex/origin/diploma/bank account. I do realize that this model has many pros but also some pretty major cons. My only point is that it did affect my worldview. In my world, seniority, a killer  job title or a fancy suit won't buy you my automatic respect. On the other hand, job well done, great vision, honesty, over achievement will!</p>

<p>Taking these few trains of thoughts in consideration, I started thinking about my own expectations for a good manager/leader. I figured that if I were able to do that, I could possibly be able to define a work environment where I could thrive and maybe one day become a good "manager/leader".</p>

<p>I've always questioned my ability to be a good leader. While most of the time, I have an opinion and can easily decide what I think should be done, I have a hard time relating to people who can't see the "big picture". While I usually can get decent results, I'm aware that it can unfortunately sometime be at the cost of a few bruised egos. I also know I have high expectations for myself and for others and I have a hard time understanding how some people can be ok with the "status-quo". I'm a perfectionist who is only happy when he outperforms his previous achievement. I was raised to challenge and always push myself further, focusing on concrete end-results and achieved goals. And to be honest, that's what I enjoy. But I also know for a fact, that many people are not like that and I can't blame them for looking at things from a different angle and not sharing the same motivations. Furthermore, I know that most people actually don't have the same driven temperament and that's why I've questioned my abilities to lead others.</p>

<p>However, different temperaments can work together as long as there is respect. And by respect, I mean that everyone feel that they were being heard and know that their input was considered and addressed even though the outcome might not be as hoped for. But for respect to happen, you first need trust. And when people trust each other, Lencioni explains that <em>"people don't hold back one with another. They are unafraid to air their dirty laundry. They admit their mistakes, their weaknesses, and their concerns without fear of reprisal"</em>. I think that as simple as it seems, it is the key to a successful team. A good leader should be able to create such an atmosphere where people can trust each other. In fact, I think that if a manger/leader/executive can manage to build trust as defined earlier, his technical skills or lack of vision don't matter as much. He/she will be able to rely on people he trusts to help him make the right decisions. Of course, there is much more than to be a good leader, but I think that with this base, great things can be built, and without it, a much greater effort is required to get some good results.</p>

<p>Based on my findings, I think that I need to work on my communication so others don't feel that they have to hold back and make sure everyone feels that their opinions were considered and addressed. To do that a key element is to admit my mistakes and weaknesses and asking others to help me improve. That's it, sorry for the boring, not technical post. I promise the next one will have at least a code sample.</p>

    <updated>2011-10-03T21:23:54+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/10/03/about-concurrency-and-the-gil</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During RubyConf 2011, concurrency was a really hot topic. This is not a new issue, and the JRuby team has been talking about true concurrency for quite a while . The Global Interpreter Lock has also been in a subject a<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"> lot of discussions in the Python community</a> and it's not surprising that the Ruby community experiences the same debates since the evolution of their implementations are somewhat similar. (There might also be some tension between <a href="http://engineyard.com">EngineYard</a> hiring the JRuby and Rubinius teams and <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> which <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/7/12/matz_joins_heroku/">recently hired Matz</a> (Ruby's creator) and <a href="https://github.com/nobu">Nobu</a>, the #1 C Ruby contributor)</p>

<p>The GIL was probably even more of a hot topic now that <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> is about the join <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> in the realm of GIL-less Ruby implementations.</p>

<p>During my RubyConf talk (<a href="http://rubyconf11.merbist.com/">slides here</a>), I tried to explain how C Ruby works and why some decisions like having a GIL were made and why the Ruby core team isn't planning on removing this GIL anytime soon. The GIL is something a lot of Rubyists love to hate, but a lot of people don't seem to question why it's here and why Matz doesn't want to remove it. Defending the C Ruby decision isn't quite easy for me since I spend my free time working on an alternative Ruby implementation which doesn't use a GIL (MacRuby). However, I think it's important that people understand why the MRI team (C Ruby team) and some Pythonistas feels so strongly about the GIL.</p>

<p><strong>What is the GIL?</strong></p>

<p>Here is a quote from the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Python wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In CPython, the <strong>global interpreter lock</strong>, or <strong>GIL</strong>, is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe. (However, since the GIL exists, other features have grown to depend on the guarantees that it enforces.) [...] The GIL is controversial because it prevents multithreaded CPython programs from taking full advantage of multiprocessor systems in certain situations. Note that potentially blocking or long-running operations, such as I/O, image processing, and <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumPy">NumPy</a> number crunching, happen <em>outside</em> the GIL. Therefore it is only in multithreaded programs that spend a lot of time inside the GIL, interpreting CPython bytecode, that the GIL becomes a bottleneck.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same basically applies to C Ruby. To illustrate the quote above, here is a diagram representing two threads being executed by C Ruby:</p>

<p><a href="http://rubyconf11.merbist.com/#44"><img src="http://rubyconf11.merbist.com/images/thread_scheduling.023.jpg" alt="Fair thread scheduling in Ruby by Matt Aimonetti" /></a></p>

<p>Such a scheduling isn't a problem at all when you only have 1 cpu, since a cpu can only execute a piece of code at a time and context switching happens all the time to allow the machine to run multiple processes/threads in parallel. The problem is when you have more than 1 CPU because in that case, if you were to only run 1 Ruby process, then you would most of the time only use 1 cpu at a time. If you are running on a 8 cpu box, that's not cool at all! A lot of people stop at this explanation and imagine that their server can only handle one request at a time and they they rush to sign Greenpeace petitions asking Matz to make Ruby greener by optimizing Ruby and saving CPU cycles. Well, the reality is slightly different, I'll get back to that in a minute. Before I explain "ways to achieve true concurrency with CRuby, let me explain why C Ruby uses a GIL and why each implementation has to make an important choice and in this case both CPython and C Ruby chose to keep their GIL.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Why a GIL in the first place?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It makes developer's lives easier (it's harder to corrupt data)</p></li>
<li><p>It avoids race conditions within C extensions</p></li>
<li><p>It makes C extensions development easier (no write barriers..)</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the C libraries which are wrapped are not thread safe</p></li>
<li><p>Parts of Ruby's implementation aren't threadsafe (Hash for instance)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see the arguments can be organized in two main categories: data safety and C extensions/implementation. An implementation which doesn't rely too much on C extensions (because they run a bit slow, or because code written in a different language is preferred) is only faced with one argument: data safety.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Should C Ruby remove its GIL?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>No: it potentially makes Ruby code unsafe(r)</p></li>
<li><p>No: it would break existing C extensions</p></li>
<li><p>No: it would make writing C extensions harder</p></li>
<li><p>No: it's a lot of work to change make C Ruby threadsafe</p></li>
<li><p>No: Ruby is fast enough in most cases</p></li>
<li><p>No: Memory optimization and GC is more important to tackle first</p></li>
<li><p>No: C Ruby code would run slower</p></li>
<li><p>Yes: we really need better/real concurrency</p></li>
<li><p>Yes: <a href="https://plus.google.com/107994348420168435683/posts/993U42yVbfk">Rubber boots analogy (Gustavo Niemeyer)</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Don't count the amount of pros/cons to jump to the conclusion that removing the GIL is a bad idea. A lot of the arguments for removing the GIL are related. At the end of the day it boils down to data safety. During the Q&amp;A section of my RubyConf talk, Matz came up on stage and said data safety was the main reason why C Ruby still has a GIL. Again, this is a topic which was discussed at length in the Python community and I'd encourage you to read arguments from the <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> (the equivalent of JRuby for Python) developers, <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/faq.html#does-pypy-have-a-gil-why">the PyPy</a> (the equivalent of Rubinius in the Python community) and CPython developers. (a good collection of arguments are actually available in the comments related to the <a href="https://plus.google.com/107994348420168435683/posts/993U42yVbfk">rubber boots post mentioned earlier</a>)</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How can true concurrency be achieved using CRuby?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Run multiple processes (which you probably do if you use Thin, Unicorn or Passenger)</p></li>
<li><p>Use event-driven programming with a process per CPU</p></li>
<li><p>MultiVMs in a process. Koichi presented his plan to run multiple VMs within a process.  Each VM would have its own GIL and inter VM communication would be faster than inter process. This approach would solve most of the concurrency issues but at the cost of memory.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Note:  forking a process only saves memory when using REE since it implements a GC patch that makes the forking process Copy on Write friendly. The Ruby core team worked on a patch for Ruby 1.9 to achieve the same result. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nari_en">Nari</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/yukihiro_matz">Matz</a> are currently working on improving the implementation to make sure overall performance isn't affected.</p>

<p>Finally, when developing web applications, each thread spend quite a lot of time in IOs which, as mentioned above won't block the thread scheduler. So if you receive two quasi-concurrent requests you might not even be affected by the GIL as illustrated in <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/08/14/threads-in-ruby-enough-already/">this diagram from Yehuda Katz</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://yehudakatz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Untitled.002.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a simplified diagram but you can see that a good chunk of the request life cycle in a Ruby app doesn't require the Ruby thread to be active (CPU Idle blocks) and therefore these 2 requests would be processed almost concurrently.</p>

<p>To boil it down to something simplified, when it comes to the GIL, an implementor has to chose between data safety and memory usage. But it is important to note that context switching between threads is faster than context switching between processes and data safety can and is often achieved in environments without a GIL, but it requires more knowledge and work on the developer side.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The decision to keep or remove the GIL is a bit less simple that it is often described. I respect Matz' decision to keep the GIL even though, I would personally prefer to push the data safety responsibility to the developers. However, I do know that many Ruby developers would end up shooting themselves in the foot and I understand that Matz prefers to avoid that and work on other ways to achieve true concurrency without removing the GIL. What is great with our ecosystem is that we have some diversity, and if you think that a GIL less model is what you need, we have some great alternative implementations that will let you make this choice. I hope that this article will help some Ruby developers understand and appreciate C Ruby's decision and what this decision means to them on a daily basis.</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/09/14/how-to-cross-domain-ajax-in-a-ruby-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In some cases, you might have a bunch of apps running on different domains/subdomains and/or ports and you would like to make ajax requests between these services. The problem is that browsers wouldn't let you make such requests because of the Same Origin Policy which only allowed them to make request to resources within the same domain.</p>

<p>However, most browsers (IE 8+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Chrome) implement a simple way to allow cross domain requests as defined in this <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">w3C document</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, if your users have an old version of their browser, you  might have to look into jsonp or something else such as cheating by using iframes &amp; setting document.domain. Let's pretend for a minute that 100% of your users are on Chrome. The only thing you need to do is set a response header listing the accepted domains or "*" for all. A simple Rack middleware to do that would look like that.</p>

<p> </p>

<pre><code>class XOriginEnabler
  ORIGIN_HEADER = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"

  def initialize(app, accepted_domain="*")
    @app = app
    @accepted_domain = accepted_domain
  end

  def call(env)
    status, header, body = @app.call(env)
    header[ORIGIN_HEADER] = @accepted_domain
    [status, header, body]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And to use the middleware you would need to set it for use:</p>

<pre><code>use XOriginEnabler
</code></pre>

<p>To enable all requests from whatever origin, or pass the white listed domain(s) as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>use XOriginEnabler, "demo.mysite.com demo.mysite.fr demo.techcrunch.com"
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/09/05/ruby-optimization-example-and-explaination/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-05T14:58:21+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/09/05/ruby-optimization-example-and-explaination</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I wrote a small DSL that allows the user to define some code that then gets executed later on and in different contexts. Imagine something like Sinatra where each route action is defined in a block and then executed in context of an incoming request.</p>

<p>The challenge is that blocks come with their context and you can't execute a block in the context of another one.</p>

<p>Here is a reduction of the challenge I was trying to solve:</p>

<pre><code>class SolutionZero
  def initialize(origin, &amp;block;)
    @origin = origin
    @block = block
  end

  def dispatch
    @block.call
  end
end

SolutionZero.new(42){ @origin + 1 }.dispatch
# undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the block refers to the @origin instance variable which is not available in its context.
My first workaround was to use instance_eval:</p>

<pre><code>class SolutionOne
  def initialize(origin, &amp;block;)
    @origin = origin
    @block = block
  end

  def dispatch
    self.instance_eval &amp;@block
  end
end

SolutionOne.new(40){ @origin + 2}.dispatch
# 42
</code></pre>

<p>My workaround worked fine, since the block was evaluated in the context of the instance and therefore the @origin ivar is made available to block context. Technically, I was good to go, but I wasn't really pleased with this solution. First using instance_eval often an indication that you are trying to take a shortcut. Then having to convert my block stored as a block back into a proc every single dispatch makes me sad. Finally, I think that this code is probably not performing as well as it could, mainly due to unnecessary object allocations and code evaluation.
I did some benchmarks replacing <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/vm_eval.c#L1323">instance_eval</a> by <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/vm_eval.c#L1355">instance_exec</a> since looking at the C code, instance_exec should be slightly faster. Turns out, it is not so I probably missed something when reading the implementation code.</p>

<p>I wrote some more benchmarks and profiled a loop of 2 million dispatches (only the #disptach method call on the same object). The GC profiler report showed that the GC was invoked 287 times and each invocation was blocking the execution for about 0.15ms.
Using Ruby's <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/ObjectSpace.html#M001526">ObjectSpace</a> and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/GC.html#M001373">disabling the GC</a> during the benchmark, I could see that each loop allocates an object of type T_NODE which is more than likely our @block ivar converted back into a block. This is quite a waste. Furthermore, having to evaluate our block in a different context every single call surely isn't good for performance.</p>

<p>So instead of doing the work at run time, why not doing it at load time? By that I mean that we can optimize the #dispatch method if we could "precompile" the method body instead of "proxying" the dispatch to an instance_eval call. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>class SolutionTwo
  def initialize(origin, &amp;block;)
    @origin = origin
    implementation(block)
  end

  private

  def implementation(block)
    mod = Module.new
    mod.send(:define_method, :dispatch, block)
    self.extend mod
  end
end

SolutionTwo.new(40){ @origin + 2}.dispatch
# 42
</code></pre>

<p>This optimization is based on the fact that the benchmark (and the real life usage) creates the instance once and then calls #dispatch many times. So by making the initialization of our instance a bit slower, we can drastically improve the performance of the method call. We also still need to execute our block in the right context. And finally, each instance might have a different way to dispatch since it is defined dynamically at initialization. To work around all these issues, we create a new module on which we define a new method called dispatch and the body of this method is the passed block. Then we simply our instance using our new module.</p>

<p>Now every time we call #dispatch, a real method is dispatched which is much faster than doing an eval and no objects are allocated. Running the profiler and the benchmarks script used earlier, we can confirm that the GC doesn't run a single time and that the optimized code runs 2X faster!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once again, it's yet another example showing that you <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/07/29/object-allocation-why-you-should-care/">should care about object allocation</a> when dealing with code in the critical path. It also shows how to work around the block bindings. Now, it doesn't mean that you have to obsess about object allocation and performance, even if my last implementation is 2X faster than the previous, we are only talking about a few microseconds per dispatch. That said microseconds do add up and creating too many objects will slow down even your faster code since the GC will stop-the-world as its cleaning up your memory. In real life, you probably don't have to worry too much about low level details like that, unless you are working on a framework or sharing your code with others. But at least you can learn and understand why one approach is faster than the other, it might not be useful to you right away, but if you take programming as a craft, it's good to understand how things work under the hood so you can make educated decisions.
 </p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>@apeiros in the comments suggested a solution that works &amp; performs the same as my solution, but is much cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>class SolutionTwo
  def initialize(origin, &amp;block;)
    @origin = origin
    define_singleton_method(:dispatch, block) if block_given?
  end
end

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/08/30/deploying-a-rails-3-1-app-gotchas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had to build a new app as part of my research &amp; development job at <a href="http://livingsocial.com">LivingSocial</a>. My goal was to get the app up and running in just a few weeks, solid application architecture and graphic design included.
When you need to build an app quickly and you want it to have some solid foundations, Rails is quite useful.
I used Rails 3.1RCx so if we would to keep my app and push it to production, the engineering team wouldn't have to update it and the transition should be seamless. I also quite like <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> and the app being quite heavy on JavaScript, the choice was easy. Furthermore, my coworker <a href="http://codefluency.com/">Bruce Williams</a> is a fan of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> and he's writing a <a href="http://pragprog.com/">PragProg</a> book called "The Rails View" with other LivingSocialist: <a href="http://www.boboroshi.com/">John Athayde</a>. So you got the point, I'm using Rails3.1, but this post is about the challenges I faced when it was time to deploy and the solutions I found.</p>

<p>I'll skip the intro to Rails 3.1 and how to use the new asset pipeline, refer to the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Rails guide</a> or one of the mainly posts referenced in t<a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/06/06/helpful-resources-for-upgrading-to-rails-3-1/">his post</a> (if I had properly read the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">guide</a>, it would have saved me some valuable time, trust me, read it carefuly).</p>

<p>At that point last night, I had my app working great locally, Bruce created some awesome scss code using mixins and nested rules, the HTML was clean and working great, my <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> was brewing nicely, all was great until I tried to deploy to our QA environment.</p>

<h3>JavaScript runtime dependency</h3>

<p>The first thing you will notice is that you need the proper JavaScript runtime so the asset pipeline works properly. Not a big deal, you'll find a lot of documentation about that. The problem is that you need to update your production environment or use depend on gem that will compile the required runtime (sounds dirty to me). So if you are deploying to many machines and you are using an image solution (EC2 AMI or other), you will need to update your image or spin new instances via updated chef/puppet recipes. In this case, the awesome team at LivingSocial had an image ready for me, so that wasn't a big deal, but still, you need to take that in consideration as you are planning to update.</p>

<p>So the asset pipeline optimizes your asset management by processing/compiling asset files for you and optimizing their delivery. Instead of serving static files directly via public/images or public/javascripts you know serve them via the asset pipeline which will take care of compiling your CoffeeScript, grouping and minifying your JS and preprocessing all sorts of format. It also optimizes the caching process by giving a unique filename to each file based on the file metadata and gziping files. This is great, but you really, really, really don't want to have your apps take care of that in production. Why wasting precious resources to serve assets when they can be prepared ahead of time. (by making Rails serve static assets, you are seriously reducing the throughput of  your app, please think of the children (or the dolphins/trees if you don't like children))</p>

<h3>Capistrano</h3>

<p>Rails obviously has a preprocessor available as a rake task and you should update your deployment recipe to use that new feature. Here is my Capistrano code:</p>

<pre><code>after 'deploy:update_code', 'deploy:compile_assets'
namespace :deploy do
  task :compile_assets do
    run "cd #{release_path}; RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Well, my real code doesn't hardcode the RAILS_ENV constant value, it's in fact set in each env file, but I simplified it since most people only use 1 env outside of dev &amp; test.</p>

<p>What that will do is compile all the files and dump them in public/assets/. But the file I had called bubble.png now becomes bubble-27543c671a3ab45141ee0d3216085009.png which means that my app is totally broken because images use in Bruce SCSS don't load, my js files don't load and the app is totally broken. Now this is least fun part, that I wish I had known before. This is where you go back and change your code so it uses magic to get the right file names.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Fixing images was actually quite simple, in all my views, I just had to make sure I was using the image_tag helper everywhere.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<p>SCSS files were a bit more tricky, I had to use the new scss preprocessor helpers you will find in the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Rails guide</a> (image_path and image_url). I first looked into using erb, but turned out it wasn't needed and the end result is much cleaner.</p>

<h3>Javascript/CoffeeScript</h3>

<p>For the CoffeeScript files, I was referring to image assets in the code and of course all the links were broken. So I had to use ERB in my coffee which looked funky but it worked.</p>

<p>But to get that to work, you need to rename your coffee script and append erb at the end. For instance my feature.js.coffee script had to be renamed feature.js.coffee.erb. That made me cry a little inside, but oh well, at least its not a XML config file. Maybe soon we will start seeing code in filenames or filenames called my_feature.js.compressed.minified.coffee.erb.from_rails.mattetti.org
Also, be careful about the order of the file extensions, otherwise it won't work. I thought I was done, ready to deploy my apps and this time the assets will show up properly. Turns out I was wrong :(</p>

<h3>Rails asset precompilation env specific configuration.</h3>

<p>My css looked good, the precompiling task had run fine but I was missing some js files. I scratched my head as I could only see some of my js files. I then realized that all my JS files were there but some of my CoffeeScript files were missing. The answer was given to me by Bruce who asked me if I had updated my "config.assets.precompile" setting. Sometimes I feel that Rails is trying to compete with Struts and here I was really surprised that by default Rails, in production mode only precompiles all static JS and application.js files, but none of the other dynamic js files. Now it does precompile all the scss files, but for a reason I just don't understand, it's not the case for the JS files. So, you have to go edit production.rb in the config/environments folder and add the other js files you would like Rails to precompile for you.</p>

<p>After making all these changes, I was able to redeploy my app and everything was working again. (you might want to tweak your apache/nginx config as explained in the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Rails guide</a>)</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Don't be fooled like me and expect that because you have an app running locally, deployment will work right away. Make sure to read about the new features and what's needed. Overall, I think that the asset pipeline is a nice addon to Rails and if you don't feel like using it, just can put/leave all your files in the public folder and everything will work just like before. I do have to say that I was surprised to see that even in a brand new Rails 3.1 project, Rails isn't running in threaded mode by default. But that's a different (old) story and I guess people still get more excited about asset management than framework raw performance ;)</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/07/11/first-step-in-scaling-a-web-site-http-caching/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-11T10:21:02+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/07/11/first-step-in-scaling-a-web-site-http-caching</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/mokolabs">Patrick Crowley</a> and I were talking about scaling his website: <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/">http://cinematreasures.org</a> since an article covering his work will soon be published in a very popular newspaper. Patrick's site is hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> which comes by default with <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish caching</a> enabled.</p>

<p>The challenge is that a lot of people using the Rails framework are used to doing page caching instead of relying on HTTP caching, even though this feature was added a long time ago. The major problem with page caching is that it doesn't scale that well as soon as you run more than one server. Indeed you would need to store the page content to a shared drive between your servers or use memcached and do some work to avoid hitting your app every single time. On the other hand, HTTP caching is extremely easy to handle at the application level and it will dramatically reduce the amount of requests hitting your app. Let me explain a little more about HTTP caching.</p>

<p>Ryan Tomako wrote an <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do">excellent post</a> about the details of caching, I strongly recommend you <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do">read it</a>. In a nutshell, the HTTP caching layer (usually) seats before your application layer and allows you, the developer to store some responses that can be send back to the users based on optional conditions. That might still seem vague, let's take a concrete example. If you look at <a href="http://cinematreasures.org">http://cinematreasures.org</a>'s home page you can see that it's an agglomerate of various information:</p>

<p><a href="http://cinematreasures.org"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110709-dnxjhikxr14tdr7e35n97madhn.jpg" alt="CinemaTreasures homepage" /></a></p>

<p>And the bottom of the page contains even more dynamic data such as the popular movie theater photos, latest movie theater videos and latest tweets. One might look at that and say that this page can't really be cached and that the caching should be done at the model layer (i.e. cache the data coming from the database). I would certainly agree that caching the data layer is probably a good idea, but you shouldn't start by that. In fact without caching, this page renders fast enough. The problem is when someone like <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/">Roger Ebert</a> tweets about <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ebertchicago/status/85912164648497152">CinemaTreasures</a> the load on the app peaks significantly. At the point, the amount of concurrent connections your app can handle gets put to the challenge. Even though your page load is "fast enough", requests will queue up and some will eventually time out. That's actually a perfect case of HTTP caching.</p>

<p>What we want to do in that case is to cache a version of the home page in Varnish for 60 seconds. During that time, all requests coming to the site, will be served by Varnish and will all get the same cached content. That allows our servers to handle the non cached requests and therefore increase our throughput. What's even better, is that if a user refreshes the home page in his/her browser during the first 60 seconds the requests won't even make it all the way to our servers. All of that thanks to conditions set on the response. The first user hitting the HTTP cache layer (Varnish in this case) won't find a fresh cached response, so varnish will forward the request to our application layer which will send back the homepage to varnish and tell Varnish that this content is good for a full minute so please don't ask for it again until a minute from now. Varnish serves this response to the users' browser and let the browser know that the server said that the response was good enough for a minute so don't bother asking for it again. But now, if during these 60 seconds another user comes in, he will hit Varnish and Varnish will have the cached response from the first user and because the cache is still fresh (it's not been 60 seconds since the first request) and the cache is public, then the same response will be sent to the second user.</p>

<p>As you can see, the real strength of HTTP caching is the fact that it's a conditional caching. It's based on the request's URL and some "flags" set in the request/response headers.</p>

<p>Setting these conditions in your app is actually very simple since you just need to set the response's headers. If you are using a Ruby framework you will more than likely have access to the request object via the "request" method and you can set the headers directly like that: "response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=60'".
In Rails, you can actually use a helper method instead: expires_in 1.minute, :public => true.</p>

<p>You might have a case where you HAVE TO serve fresh content if available and can't serve stale cached content even for a few seconds. In this case, you can rely on the Etag header value. The Etag is meant to validate the freshness of a cached response. Think of it as a signature (unique ID) that is set on the response and used by the client (or cache layer) to see if the server response has changed or not. The way it works is that the client keeps track of the Etag received for each request (attached to the cached response) and then sends it with the next requests. The HTTP layer or application sees the Etag in the request and can check if it is still valid and the content didn't change. If that's the case, an empty response can be sent with a special HTTP status code (304) to let know the client that the old cached value is still good to be used.  Rails has a helper called "stale?" that helps you do the Etag/last modified check and allows you to not fetch all the objects from the database by doing a cheap check on an attribute (For instance you can check the updated_at value and use that as a condition to pull an object and its relationships).</p>

<p>So I explain HTTP caching, I often hear people telling me: "that's great Matt, but you know what, that won't work for us because we have custom content that we display specifically to our users". So in that case, you can always set the Cache-Control header to private which will only cache the response in the client's browser and not the cache layer. That's good to some extent, but it can definitely be improved by rethinking a bit your view layer. In most web apps, the page content is rendered by server side code (Rails, Django, node.js, PHP..) and sent to the user all prepared for him. There are a few challenges with this approach, the biggest one is that the server has to wait until everything is ready (all data fetched, view rendered etc...) before sending back a response and before the client's browser can start rendering (there are ways to chunk the response but that's besides the scope of this post). The other is that the same expensive content has to be calculated/rendered for two different users because you might be inserting the username of the current user at the top of the page for instance. A classic way to deal with that is often to use fragment caching, where the expensive rendering is cached and reused by different requests. That's good but if the only reason to do that is because we are displaying some user specific data, there is a simpler way: async page rendering. The concept is extremely simple: remove all user specific content from the rendered page and then inject the user content in a second step once the page is displayed. The advantage is that now the full page can be cached in Varnish (or Squid or whatever you use for HTTP caching). To inject the user content, the easiest way is to use JavaScript.</p>

<p>Let's stay on CinemaTreasures, when you're logged in, the username is shown on the top of each page:</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="574" caption="Once logged in, the username is displayed on all pages"]<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110710-mh5tqxuw1txf9kppn1smkkarrs.jpg" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>The only things that differs from the page rendered when the user is not logged in and when he is, are these 2 links and an avatar. So let's write some code to inject that after rendering the page.</p>

<p>In Rails, in the sessions controller or whatever code logs you in, you need to create a new cookie containing the username:</p>

<pre><code>cookies[:username] = {
         :value =&gt; session[:username],
         :expires =&gt; 2.days.from_now,
         :domain =&gt; ".cinematreasures.org"
       }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we don't store the data in the session cookie and the data won't be encrypted. You need to be careful that someone changing his cookie value can't access data he/should shouldn't. But that's a different discussion. Now that the cookie is set, we can read it from JavaScript when the page is loaded.</p>

<pre><code>document.observe("dom:loaded", function() {
  displayLoggedinUserLinks();
});

function readCookie(name) {
     var nameEQ = name + "=";
     var ca = document.cookie.split(';');
     for(var i=0;i &lt; ca.length;i++) {
          var c = ca[i];
          while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);
          if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);
     }
     return null;
}

function displayLoggedinUserLinks() {
  var username            = readCookie('username');
  var loginLink           = $('login');
  var logout              = $('logout');
  if (username == null){
    loginLink.show();
    logout.hide();
  }else{
    // user is logged in and we have his/her username
    loginLink.hide();
    if(userGreetings){ userGreetings.update("&lt;span id="username"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;"); }
    logout.show();
    showAvatar(username);
  };
  return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above doesn't do much, once the DOM is loaded, the displayLoggedinUserLinks() function gets trigger. This function reads the cookie via the readCookie() function and if a username is found, the login link is hidden, the user name is displayed, as well as the logout link and the avatar. (You can also use a jQuery cookie plugin to handle the cookie, but this is an old example using Prototype, replace the code accordingly)
When the user logs out, we just need to delete the username cookie and the cached page will be rendered properly. In Rails, you would do delete the cookie like that: cookies.delete('username').
Quite often you might even want to make an Ajax call to get some information such as the number of user messages or notifications. Using jQuery or whatever JS framework you fancy you can do that once the page is rendered. Here is an example, on this page, you can see the learderboards for MLB The Show. The leaderboards don't change that often, especially the overall leaderboards so they can be cached for a little while, however the player's presence can change anytime. The smart way to deal with that, would be to cache the  leaderboards for a few seconds/minutes and make an ajax call to a presence service passing it a list of user ids collected from the DOM. The service called via Ajax could also be cached  depending on the requirements.</p>

<p>Now there is one more problem that people using might encouter: flash notices. For those of you not familiar with Rails, flash notices are messages set in the controller and passed to the view via the session (at least last time I checked). The problem happens if I'm the home page isn't cached anymore and I logged in which redirects me to the home page with a flash message like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110710-1u6dn8rrc6r62rsg6niphhd2pi.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem is that the message is part of the rendered page and now for 60 seconds, all people hitting the home page will get the same message. This is why you would want to write a helper that would put this message in a custom cookie that you'd pull JS and then delete once displayed. You could use a helper like that to set the cookie:</p>

<pre><code>def flash_notice_cookie(msg, expiration=nil)
  cookies[:flash_notice] = {
    :value =&gt; msg,
    :expires =&gt; expiration || 1.minutes.from_now,
    :domain =&gt; ".cinematreasures.com"
   }
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then add a function called when the DOM is ready which loads the message and injects it in the DOM. Once the cookie read, delete it so the message isn't displayed again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So there you have it, if you follow these few steps, you should be able to handle easily 10x more traffic without increasing hardware or making any type of crazy code change. Before you start looking into memcached, redis, cdns or whatever, consider HTTP caching and async DOM manipulation. Finally, note that if you can't use Varnish or Squid, you can very easily setup <a href="http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/">Rack-Cache</a> locally and share the cache via memcached. It's also a great way to test locally.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update:</strong> CinemaTreasures was updated to use HTTP caching as described above. The hosting cost is now half of what it used to be and the throughput is actually higher which offers a better protection against peak traffic.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/06/27/golang-reflection-exampl/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-27T12:12:32+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/06/27/golang-reflection-exampl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://golang.org/">Go Programming language</a> is really cool language by Google. According to the sales pitch, it's a <strong><em>"fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language"</em></strong>. Well, if you are like me, you don't trust sales pitches because you know that people writing them dont' care about you, they care about their product. However cynical you are, you still have to check the facts. So here is a quick demonstration showing how to use Go's reflection feature.</p>

<p>Installing Go is actually really straight forward on a Mac, and slightly harder on Linux, check <a href="http://golang.org/doc/install.html">this guide </a>to see how to build Go in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Once all setup, you might want to read the documentation to see how to code in Go. Go is actually a kind of nice version of C with a<a href="http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html"> simplified syntax</a>, no header files, really fast compilation time, a garbage collector and a <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html?#interfaces_and_types">simple way to approach object inheritance</a> without turning in the complicated mess C++ is. The language is designed around the concept of <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html?h=goroutines#concurrency">goroutines, a very nice way to handle concurrency</a>. It also has some features that Rubyists, Pythonistas and Javascripters wouldn't want to live without such as closures and some they probably wish they had such as <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html?#defer">defer</a>. But of the things we are used to with dynamic languages is the concept of reflection. In a nutshell, at runtime, your code can reflect on the type of a given object and let the developer act accordingly. Depending on your programming background that might be obvious or you might not see the value. To be honest, that's not the question here. What I'm interested in showing you is how it works.</p>

<p>For the sake of this demo, let's pretend we want to have a "Dish" data model, each instance of the "Dish" type will have a few attributes, an id, a name, an origin and a custom query which really is a function that we store as an attribute. Here is how we would represent that model in Go:</p>

<pre><code>// Data Model
type Dish struct {
  Id  int
  Name string
  Origin string
  Query func()
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is more or less the equivalent of the following Ruby code:</p>

<pre><code>class Dish
  attr_accessor :id, :name, :origin, :query
end
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby works slightly differently in the sense that defining attribute accessors create getters and setter methods but doesn't technically create instance variables until they are used. Here is what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>shabushabu = Dish.new
shabushabu.instance_variables # =&gt; []
shabushabu.name = "Shabu-Shabu"
shabushabu.instance_variables # =&gt; ["@name"]
shabushabu.origin = "Japan"
shabushabu.instance_variables # =&gt; ["@name", "@origin"]
</code></pre>

<p>Another way of checking on the accessors is to check the methods defined on the object:</p>

<pre><code>shabushabu.methods - Object.new.methods
=&gt; ["name", "name=", "origin", "origin=", "id=", "query", "query="]
</code></pre>

<p>But anyway, this post isn't about Ruby, it's about Go and what we would like is to reflect on an object of "Dish" type and see its attributes. The good news is that the Go language ships with a <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/">package to do just that</a>. Here is the full implementation:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import(
  "fmt"
  "reflect"
)

func main(){
  // iterate through the attributes of a Data Model instance
  for name, mtype := range attributes(&amp;Dish;{}) {
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Type %s\n", name, mtype.Name())
  }
}

// Data Model
type Dish struct {
  Id  int
  Name string
  Origin string
  Query func()
}

// Example of how to use Go's reflection
// Print the attributes of a Data Model
func attributes(m interface{}) (map[string]reflect.Type) {
  typ := reflect.TypeOf(m)
  // if a pointer to a struct is passed, get the type of the dereferenced object
  if typ.Kind() == reflect.Ptr{
    typ = typ.Elem()
  }

  // create an attribute data structure as a map of types keyed by a string.
  attrs := make(map[string]reflect.Type)
  // Only structs are supported so return an empty result if the passed object
  // isn't a struct
  if typ.Kind() != reflect.Struct {
    fmt.Printf("%v type can't have attributes inspected\n", typ.Kind())
    return attrs
  }

  // loop through the struct's fields and set the map
  for i := 0; i &lt; typ.NumField(); i++ {
    p := typ.Field(i)
      if !p.Anonymous {
        attrs[p.Name] = p.Type
      }
     }

  return attrs
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, my code highlighter doesn't support the Go syntax, but GitHub does, so here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/1009629">pretty version</a>.</p>

<p>There are ways of running Go source code like Ruby or Python scripts but in this case, we'll use the compiler &amp; linker provided with Go. I named my source file "example.go", and here is how I compiled, linked and run it:</p>

<pre><code>$ 6g example.go &amp;&amp; 6l example.6 &amp;&amp; ./6.out
Name: Origin, Type string
Name: Id, Type int
Name: Query, Type 
Name: Name, Type string
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see each attribute is printed out with its name and type. The code might seem a bit odd if you never looked at Go before.
Here is a quick rundown of the code:</p>

<p>In our main function, we create a new instance of type Dish on which we call attributes on. The call returns a map on which we iterate through and print the attribute name (key) and type (value).
The attributes function is defined a bit below and and it takes any type of objects (empty interface) and returns a map, which is like a Hash or a Dictionary. The map has keys of String type and values of "Type" type. The "Type" type is defined in the reflect package. Inside the function, 23 then use the previously mentioned reflect package to check on the type and the name of each attribute and assign it to a map object. (note that I'm explicitly returning the map, but I could have done it in a more implicit way)</p>

<p>So there you go, that's how you use reflection in Go. Pretty nifty and simple.</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/06/10/sayonara-sony</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's now official, I have resigned from Sony Computer Entertainment America.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/playstation-logo.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/playstation-logo-150x150.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I was planning on posting this a bit later but since I was politely escorted out of the building by HR/security, I have more free time to let you know of my decision. Before you ask: No, my decision isn't directly related to the recent PSN/Sony security breach events and no, I don't have your credit card number. More seriously, my decision boils down to something much simpler &amp; concrete: drive and passion.</p>

<p>The concept of drive is very well explained <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">in this talk</a> by <a href="http://www.danpink.com/">Dan Pink</a> and illustrated by <a href="http://www.thersa.org/">RSA</a>:</p>

<p>As explained, it is proven that when doing cognitive tasks, there are 3 factors that lead to better performance &amp; personal satisfaction:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Autonomy: engagement vs compliance</p></li>
<li><p>Mastery: get better at stuff</p></li>
<li><p>Purpose: be disruptive but make the world a better place</p></li>
</ul>


<p> </p>

<p>The challenge is that when you work for a big corporation, you rarely see these factors applied. The amount of red tape, management overhead, lack of recognition and accountability result in a low drive by most employees. I think it was the first time in my entire career that I was told by a <a href="http://nateware.com">manager</a> to care less about the quality and end result of our products.</p>

<p>The second important concept that I think is critical when looking at your career is passion. This topic is very well covered in <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>'s book: <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer"><img src="http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/137/cfcar2_xlargecover.jpg?1298589825" alt="" /></a>Here is a quote from Chad's book:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fulfillment and happiness don’t (often) come by chance. They require thought, intention, action, and a willingness to change course when you’ve made mistakes. [...] It might be a technology or business domain that gets you excited. Or, on the other hand, it might be a specific technology or business domain that drags you down. Or a type of organization. Maybe you’re meant for small teams or big teams. Or rigid processes. Or agile processes. Whatever the mix, take some time to find yours. You can fake it for a while, but a lack of passion will catch up with you and your work.</p></blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It's hard to summarize Chad's book into just a few sentences, but what I got from his book is that if, for whatever reason, you lose your passion for your job, you should move on to another place where you can be passionate and excel. In my case, I'm still very much passionate about video game development but I find my passion seriously affected by an unhealthy work environment, bad communication and a lack of desire to change things in concrete ways. As the saying goes, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=people+don't+leave+jobs">"People don't leave jobs..."</a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What's next for me?</h3>

<p>If you are in the software industry you know that everybody is hiring and that there is a real shortage of talent out there. You probably also receive half a dozen emails per week from recruiters offering you "the best job ever" with an obscene salary. Well, I receive them too. But in this market, you and I can allow ourselves to be picky and to choose the right job for ourselves. By choosing the right job, we are going to be more passionate, more driven, more efficient and bring a lot more value to our employers, who, in return, will hopefully do everything they can to make sure we grow within the company with a strong desire to do even better. As I was considering what I would want to do if I were to leave Sony, I came up with a few ideas about a job:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't want to live to work, but rather, work to live. (kind of an European cliché sentence)</p></li>
<li><p>It's not about the job title.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not about the pay check.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not about how glamourous an industry  is.</p></li>
<li><p>What matters is :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the company culture.</p></li>
<li><p>the passion coming from the leaders.</p></li>
<li><p>the company's ambitions.</p></li>
<li><p>how the company rewards and respects its employees.</p></li>
<li><p>the autonomy/trust given to the employees.</p></li>
<li><p>the purpose of the company and its potential to disrupt a market/change the world.</p></li>
<li><p>personal growth within the company.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> </p>

<p>Writing this list helped me realize that I was definitely not in the right place and helped me create a list of criteria to define what kind of job I should be doing instead. As I was thinking about all that, I was reminded of this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>"One should not pursue goals that are easily achieved. One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one's greatest efforts." —Albert Einstein</p></blockquote>

<p>This is probably a personality trait, but I like/need to be at the edge of my confort zone. I need to learn new things, experience new challenges. I need to try to solve unsolved problems. So part of me needs a company with a rich culture, a great a vision and leadership, but another part also needs to be allowed to think creatively, to push the existing boundaries, to challenge myself and to try to achieve things through my greatest efforts.</p>

<p>The challenge is that over the last 5-7 years I have become a Ruby specialist. I have learned to understand and master the language, learning its pros/cons and what goes on "under the hood". I have built small and huge solutions for various domain spaces on top of Ruby. I have shared my knowledge giving talks, books, blog posts. I have also spent a lot of time expanding my own computer science knowledge, looking into other programming languages, frameworks, designs. My job at Sony was interesting due to the fact that Ruby is used in a quite singular way with very specific problems and a lot of C/C++ interaction. So while it is true that I am a Ruby specialist, I don't like that label. I don't like it because it's very limiting. My goal is to solve problems and quite often Ruby is a great tool for that, but for some problems, it is not. So I need a job where my expertise is helpful but would not limit my desire to learn new approaches, languages and skills.</p>

<p>And this is why I will soon start working as a <em>Code Alchemist in the LivingSocial R&amp;D's lab</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/2011/06/10/sayonara-sony/livingsocial-2/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/livingsocial1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>That might be a shocker at first glance. Going from working on video games to working for a daily-deal startup? It doesn't seem like a very smart career move. To be honest, that was my first reaction. But LivingSocial's VP of engineering is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chadfowler">Chad Fowler</a> (the author of The Passionate Programmer, mentioned earlier) and its VP of R&amp;D is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kilmer_(programmer">Rich Kilmer</a>), InfoEther's cofounder and recognized mad-scientist-coder. I've known Chad and Rich for many years, meeting at tech conferences that they organized or were invited to give talks to, and even getting to hack on some projects with Rich. So when they approached me to join them at LivingSocial, I wanted to know more about their own motivations, why I would be a good fit and how the company/job would rate against my list of criteria. We had long and honest discussions and the result is that I am excited to soon be working with one of the best teams I know of. More concretely, I will be working with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rich_kilmer">Rich</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wbruce">Bruce</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/go">Michael</a> in helping LivingSocial revolutionize the local market. LivingSocial is a fast growing and successful company with a strong focus on creating a great experience for both customers and merchants. The company's vision is well defined and the desire to change the world the way we know it is palpable. Most of the founders have a technical background, they value good engineering practices and have created a nice, positive company culture. Chad has some really awesome, passionate and talented engineers on his team (too many to mention), for whom I have a lot of respect and with whom I look forward to working with.  I also value the fact that LivingSocial trusts and values me enough to let me work remotely. This is very important for me because it shows that my new employer really wants to work with me, trusts me but also is willing to embrace the challenges of having a remote team if that's what's needed to create the "right team". After looking more deeply at what I need and what LivingSocial is, I believe that I can assist LivingSocial in making a very positive change to the way small businesses around the world are run. And I am looking forward to this.</p>

    <updated>2011-04-14T10:28:39+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/04/14/video-game-web-framework-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will do my best to explain why and how I reinvented the wheel and wrote a custom web framework for some of Sony's <a href="http://www.gameproducer.net/2006/05/26/what-are-aaa-titles/">AAA console titles</a>. My goal is to reflect on my work by walking you through the design process and some of the implementation decisions. This is not about being right or being wrong, it's about designing a technical solution to solve concrete business challenges.</p>

<h2>Problem Domain</h2>

<p>The video game industry is quite special, to say the least. It shares a lot of similarities with the movie industry. The big difference is that  the movie industry hasn't evolved as quickly as the video game  industry has. But the concept is the same, someone comes up with a great  idea, finds a team/studio to develop the game and finds a publisher. The  development length and budget depends on the type of game, but for a AAA  console game, it usually takes a least a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/09/god-of-war-3-has-44-million-dollar-budget/">few million</a> and a minimum of a year of work once the project has received the green light. The creation of such a game involves various teams, designers, artists, animators, audio teams, developers, producers, QA, marketing, management/overhead etc.. Once the game gets released, players purchase the whole game for a one time fee and the studio moves  on to their next game. Of course things are not that simple, with the latest platforms, we now have the option to patch games, add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">DLC</a> etc.. But historically, a console game is considered done when it ships, exactly like a movie, and very little work is scheduled post release.</p>

<p>Concretely such an approach exposes a few challenges when trying to implement online features for a <a href="http://www.gameproducer.net/2006/05/26/what-are-aaa-titles/">AAA console title</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Communication with the game client network team</p></li>
<li><p>Scalability, performance</p></li>
<li><p>Insane deadlines, unstable design (constant change of requirements)</p></li>
<li><p>Can't afford to keep on working on the system once released (time delimited projects)</p></li>
</ul>


<p> </p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>As in most situations, communication is one of the biggest challenges. Communication is even harder in the video game industry since you have so many teams and experts involved. Each team speaks its own jargon, has its own expertise and its own deadlines. But all focus on the same goal: releasing the best game ever. The team I'm part of has implementing online features as its goal. That's the way we bring business value to our titles. Concretely, that means that we provide the game client developers with a C++ SDK which connects to custom web APIs written in Ruby. The API implementations rely on various data stores (<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>, <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>, memory) to store and retrieve all sorts of game data.</p>

<p>Nobody but our team should care about the implementation details, after all, the whole point of providing an API is to provide a simple interface so others can do their part of the job in the easiest way possible. This is exactly where communication becomes a problem. The design of these APIs should be the result of the work of two teams with two different domains of expertise and different concerns. One team focuses on client performance, memory optimization and making the online resources available to the game engine without affecting the game play. The other, focuses on server performance, latency, scalability, data storage and system contention under load. Both groups have to come together to find a compromise making each other's job doable. Unfortunately, things are not that simple and game designers (who are usually not technical people) have a hard time <em>not</em> changing their designs and requirements every other week (usually for good reasons) making API design challenging and creating tension between the teams.</p>

<p>From this perspective, the API is the most important deliverable for our team and it should communicate the design goal while being very explicit about how it works, why it works the way it does, and how to implement it client side. This is a very good place where we can improve communication by making sure that we focus on making clear, well designed, well documented, flexible APIs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Scalability, performance</h2>

<p>On the server side, the APIs need to perform and scale to handles tends of thousands of concurrent requests. Web developers often rely on aggressive <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html">HTTP caching</a> but in our case, the web client (our SDK) has a limited amount of memory available and 90% of the requests are user specific (can't use full page HTTP cache) and a lot of these are POST/DELETE requests (can't be cached). That means that, to scale, we have to focus on what most developers don't often have to worry too much about: all the small details which, put together with a high load, end up drastically affecting your performance.</p>

<p>While Ruby is a great language, a lot of the libraries and frameworks are not optimized for performance, at least not the type of performance needed for our use case. However, the good news is that this is easily fixable and many alternatives exist (lots of async, non-blocking drivers for i.e). When obsessed with performance, you quickly learn to properly load test, profile, and monitor your code to find the bottlenecks and the places where you should focus your attention. The big, unique challenge though, is that a console game will more than likely see its peak traffic in the first few weeks, not really giving the chance to the online team to iteratively handle the prod issues. The only solution is to do everything possible before going live to ensure that the system will perform as expected. Of course if we were to write the same services in a more performant language, we would need to spend less time optimizing. But we are gaining so much flexibility by using a higher level programming language that, in my mind, the trade off is totally worth it (plus you still need to spend a lot of time optimizing your code path, even if your code is written in a very fast language).</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Deadlines, requirement changes</h2>

<p>That's just part of the way the industry works. Unless you work for <a href="http://blizzard.com">Blizzard</a> and you can afford to spend a crazy amount of time and money on the development of a title; you will have to deal with sliding deadlines, requirement changes, scope changes etc... The only way I know how to protect myself from such things is to plan for the worst. Being a non-idealistic (read pessimistic) person helps a lot. When you design your software, make sure your design is sound but flexible enough to handle any major change that you know could happen at any time. Pick your battles and make sure your assumptions are properly thought through, communicated and documented so others understand and accept them. In a nutshell, this is a problem we can't avoid, so you need to embrace it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Limited reusability</h2>

<p>This topic has a lot to do with the previous paragraph. Because scopes can change often and because the deadlines are often crazy, a lot of the time, engineers don't take the time to think about reusability. They slap some code together, pray to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Kobol">lords of Kobol</a> and hope that they won't have to look at their code ever again (I'm guilty of having done that too). The result is a lot of throw away code. This is actually quite frequent and normal in our industry. But it doesn't mean that it the right thing to do! The assumption/myth is that each game is different and therefore two games can't be using the same tech solution. My take on that is that it's partly true. But some components are the same for 80% of the games I work on. So why not design them well and reuse the common parts? (A lot of games share the same engines, such as <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal</a> for example, and there is no reason why we can't build a core online engine extended for each title)</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>My approach</h2>

<p>When I joined Sony, I had limited experience with the console video game industry and my experience was not even related to online gaming. So even though I had (strong) opinions (and was often quite (perhaps even too) vocal about them), I did my best to improve existing components and work with the existing system. During that time, the team shipped 4 AAA titles on the existing system. As we were going through the game cycles, I did my best to understand the problem domain, the reasons behind some of the design decisions and finally I looked at what could be done differently to improve our business value. After releasing a title with some serious technical difficulties, I spent some time analyzing and listing the problems we had and their root causes. I asked our senior director for a mission statement and we got the team together to define the desiderata/objectives of our base technology. Here is what we came up with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stability</p></li>
<li><p>Performance / Scalability</p></li>
<li><p>Encapsulation / Modularity</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Conventions</p></li>
<li><p>Reusability / Maintainability</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These objectives are meant to help us objectively evaluate two options. The legacy solution was based on Rails, or more accurately: Rails was used in the legacy solution. Rails had been hacked in so many different ways that it was really hard to update anything without breaking random parts of the framework. The way to do basic things kept being changed, there was no consistent design, no entry points, no conventions and each new game would duplicate the source code of the previously released game and make the game specific changes. Patches were hard to back port and older titles were often not patched up. The performance was atrocious under load, mainly due to hacked-up Rails not performing well. (Rails was allocating so many objects per request that the GC was taking a huge amount of the request cycles, the default XML builder also created a ton load of objects etc...) This was your typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows scenario</a>. Engineers were getting frustrated, motivation was fainting, bugs were piling up and nobody felt ownership over the tech.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, it is important to explain that the legacy system was hacked up together due to lack of time, lack of resources and a lot of pressure to release something ASAP. So, while the end result sounds bad, the context is very important to note. This is quite common in software engineering and when you get there, the goal is not to point fingers but to identify the good and the bad parts of the original solution. You then use this info to decide what to do: fix the existing system or rewrite, porting the good parts.</p>

<p>Our report also came up with a plan. A plan to redesign our technology stack to match the desiderata previously mentioned. To put it simply, the plan was to write a new custom web framework focusing on stability, performance, modularity and documentation. Now, there are frameworks out there which already do that or value these principles. But none of them focus on web APIs and none of them are specific to game development. Finally, the other issue was that we had invested a lot of time on game specific code and we couldn't throw away all that work, so the new framework had to support a good chunk of legacy code but had to make it run much faster.</p>

<h2>Design choices</h2>

<p><strong>Low conversion cost</strong></p>

<p>Using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> &amp; <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffee script</a>/<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>/<a href="http://weblocks.viridian-project.de/">whatever</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8cgi/">new</a> <a href="https://github.com/tenderlove/phuby">fancy tech</a> was not really an option. We have a bunch of games out there which are running on the old system and some of these games will have a sequel or a game close enough that we could reuse part of the work. We don't want to have to rewrite the existing code. I therefore made sure that we could reuse 90% of the business logic by adding an abstraction layer doing the heavy lifting at boot time and therefore not affecting the runtime performance. Simple conversion scripts were also written to import the core of the existing code over.</p>

<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> It is very tempting to just redo everything and start from scratch. However, the business logic implementation wasn't the main cause of our problems. Even though I wish we could have redesigned that piece of the puzzle, it didn't make sense from a business perspective. A lot of thought had to be put into how to obtain the expected performance level while keeping the optional model/controller/view combos. By having full control of the "web engine", we managed to isolate things properly without breaking the old paradigms. We also got rid of a lot of assumptions allowing us to design new titles a bit differently while being backward compatible and have our code run dramatically faster.</p>

<p><strong>Web API centric</strong></p>

<p>This is probably the most important design element. If I had to summarize what our system does in just a few words, I would say: a game web API. Of course, it's much more than that. We have admin interfaces, producer dashboards, community websites, lobbies, p2p, BI reports, async processing jobs etc... But at the end of the day, the only one piece you can't remove is the game web API. So I really wanted the design to focus on that aspect. When a developer starts implementing a new online game feature, I want him/her to think about the API. But I also want this API to be extremely well documented so the developer working client-side understands the purpose of the API, how to use it, and what the expected response is right away. I also wanted to be able to automatically test our APIs at a very basic level so we could validate that there are discrepancies between what the client expects and what the server provides. To do that, I created a standalone API DSL with everything needed to describe your API but without any implementation details whatsoever. The API DSL lets the developer define a route (url), the HTTP verb expected, if the request should be authenticated or not, SSL or not, the param rules, default values and finally a response description (which was quite a controversial choice). All of these settings can be documented by the developer. This standalone DSL can then be consumed by different tools. For instance we have a tool extracting all the info into nicely formatted HTML doc for the game client developers. This tool doesn't need to load the framework to just render the documentation. We also use this description at boot time to compile the validation rules and routes, allowing for a much faster request dispatch. And we also use these API description to generate some low level data for the client. Finally, we used the service description DSL to help create mocked service responses allowing the client team to test service designs without having to wait for the implementation streamlining the process.</p>

<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> We had a lot of internal discussions about the need to define the response within the service description. Some argued that it's a duplication since we already had a view and we could parse that to get most of what we needed (which is what the old system was doing). We ended up going with the response description DSL for a few critical reasons: testing and implementation simplicity. <em>Testing:</em> we need to have an API expectation reference and to keep this reference sane so we can see if something is changed. If we were to magically parse the response, we couldn't test the view part of the code against a frame of reference. <em>Implementation simplicity</em>: magically parsing a view template is more tricky that it sounds, you would need to render the template with the right data to make it work properly. Furthermore, you can't document a response easily in the view, and if you do, you arguably break the separation of concern between the description and the implementation. Finally, generated documentation isn't enough and that's why we decided to write English documentation, some being close to the code and some being just good old documentation explaining things outside of the code context.</p>

<p><strong>Modularity</strong></p>

<p>In order to make our code reusable we had to isolate each component and limit the dependencies. We wrote a very simple extension layer allowing each extension to registers itself once detected. The extension interface exposes the path of the extension, its type, models, services, controllers, migrations, seed data, dependencies etc.. Each extension is contained in a folder. (The extension location doesn't matter much but as part of the framework boot sequence, we check a few default places.) The second step of the process is to check a manifest/config file that is specific to each title. The manifest file lists the extensions that should be activated for the title. The framework then activates the marked extensions and has access to libs, models, views, migrations, seed data and of course to load services (DSL mentioned earlier) etc...</p>

<p>Even though we designed the core extensions the best we could, there are cases where some titles will need to extend these extensions. To do that, we added a bunch of hooks that could be implemented on the title side if needed (Ruby makes that super easy and clean to do!). A good example of that is the login sequence or the player data.</p>

<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> The challenge with modularity is to keep things simple and highly performing yet flexible. A key element to manage that is to stay as consistent as possible. Don't implement hooks three different ways, try to keep method signatures consistent, keep it simple and organized.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's a bit early to say if this rewrite is a success or not and there are still lots of optimizations and technology improvements we are looking forward to doing. Only time will give us enough retrospect to evaluate our work. But because we defined the business value (mission statement) and the technical objectives, it is safe to say that the new framework meets the expectations quite well. On an early benchmark we noted a 10X speed improvement and that's before drilling into the performance optimizations such as making all the calls non-blocking, using better connection pools, cache write through layer... However, there is still one thing that we will have to monitor: how much business value will this framework generate. And I guess that's where we failed to define an agreed upon evaluation grid. I presume that if our developers spend more time designing and implementing APIs and less time debugging that could be considered business value. If we spend less time maintaining or fighting with the game engine, that would also be a win. Finally, if the player experience is improved we will be able to definitely say that we made the right choice.</p>

<p>To conclude, I'd like to highlight my main short coming: I failed to define metrics that would help us evaluate the real business value added to our products. What I consider a technical success might not be a business success. How do you, in your own domain, find ways to define clear and objective metrics?</p>

I'm also the author of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920000723">O'Reilly's MacRuby book</a>. As you can imagine, I'm very thankful that Apple initiated the MacRuby project a few years ago and have been an avid supporter. MacRuby is awesome to develop OS X native applications using the Ruby language and even allows you to compile down your apps to machine code. It's a great alternative to Objective-C.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111012-kyiy9nhx5n9h9wafucyh8p3knx.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>MacRuby is so awesome that Apple is even <a href="http://twitter.com/GeorgeBellos/status/41595085179203584">using it in its upcoming OS</a>. The only problem is that Apple apparently decided to not share MacRuby with other OS X developers and put <a href="http://yfrog.com/h8hhlydj">MacRuby in the OS private frameworks</a>. While this doesn't affect the project itself, it does affect OS X developers like myself who can't link to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">Lion</a>'s private MacRuby framework and are forced to embed MacRuby with their applications.</p>

<p>That's why I have opened a <a href="http://bugreporter.apple.com/">ticket on Apple radar system</a> to ask that MacRuby be made a public framework.</p>

<p>If you also want Apple to make this change, <a href="http://bugreporter.apple.com/">please take a minute and let them know</a>.</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/02/22/concurrency-in-ruby-explained</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Concurrency is certainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_Net">not a new problem</a> but it's getting more and more attention as machines start having more than 1 core, that web traffic increases drastically and that some new technologies show up saying that they are better because they handle concurrency better.
If that helps, think of concurrency as multitasking. When people say that they want concurrency, they say that they want their code to do multiple different things at the same time. When you are on your computer, you don't expect to have to choose between browsing the web and listening to some music. You more than likely want to run both concurrently. It's the same thing with your code, if you are running a webserver, you probably don't want it to only process one request at a time.
The aim of this article is to explain as simply as possible the concept of concurrency in Ruby, the reason why it's a complicated topic and finally the different solutions to achieve concurrency.</p>

<p>First off, if you are not really familiar with concurrency, take a minute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29">read the wikipedia article on the topic</a> which is a great recap on the subject. But now, you should have noticed that my above example was more about parallel programming than concurrency, but we'll come back to that in a minute.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The real question at the heart of the quest for concurrency is: "how to increase code throughput".</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>We want our code to perform better, and we want it to do more in less time. Let's take two simple and concrete examples to illustrate concurrency. First, let's pretend you are writing a twitter client, you probably want to let the user scroll his/her tweets while the latest updates are  being fetched. In other words, you don't want to block the main loop and interrupt the user interaction while your code is waiting for a response from the Twitter API. To do that, a common solution is to use multiple <strong>threads</strong>. Threads are basically processes that run in the same memory context. We would be using one thread for the main event loop and another thread to process the remote API request. Both threads share the same memory context so once the Twitter API thread is done fetching the data it can update the display. Thankfully, this is usually transparently handled by asynchronous APIs (provided by the OS or the programming language std lib) which avoid blocking the main thread.</p>

<p>The second example is a webserver. Let's say you want to run a Rails application. Because you are awesome, you expect to see a lot of traffic. Probably more than 1 QPS (query/request per second). You benchmarked your application and you know that the average response time is approximately 100ms. Your Rails app can therefore handle 10QPS using a single process (you can do 10 queries at 100ms in a second).</p>

<p>But what happens if your application gets more than 10 requests per second? Well, it's simple, the requests will be backed up and will take longer until some start timing out. This is why you want to improve your concurrency. There are different ways to do that, a lot of people feel really strong about these different solutions but they often forget to explain why they dislike one solution or prefer one over the other. You might have heard people conclusions which are often one of these: <a href="http://canrailsscale.com/">Rails can't scale</a>, you only get concurrency with <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2009/8/13/threads_suck/">threads suck</a>, the only way to concurrency is via threads, we should switch to <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>/<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>/<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, use<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/fibers-eventmachine-rack-performance-gains-3395.html"> fibers</a> and you will be fine, add more machines, <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/unicorn-is-unix">forking > threading</a>.  Depending on who said what and how often you heard it on twitter, conferences, blog posts, you might start believing what others are saying. But do you really understand why people are saying that and are you sure they are right?</p>

<p>The truth is that this is a complicated matter. The good news is that it's not <em>THAT</em> complicated!</p>

<p>The thing to keep in mind is that the concurrency models are often defined by the programming language you use. In the case of Java, <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/index.html">threading is the usual solution</a>, if you want your Java app to be more concurrent, just run every single request in its own thread and you will be fine (kinda). In PHP, you simply don't have threads, instead you will start a new process per request. Both have pros and cons, the advantage of the Java threaded approach is that the memory is shared between the threads so you are saving in memory (and startup time), each thread can easily talk to each other via the shared memory. The advantage of PHP is that you don't have to worry about locks, deadlocks, threadsafe code and all that mess hidden behind threads. Described like that it looks pretty simple, but you might wonder why PHP doesn't have threads and why Java developers don't prefer starting multiple processes. The answer is probably related to the language design decisions. PHP is a language designed for the web and for short lived processes. PHP code should be fast to load and not use too much memory. Java code is slower to boot and to warm up, it usually uses quite a lot of memory. Finally, Java is a general purpose programming language not designed primarily for the internet. Others programming languages like <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> use a third approach: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the actor model</a>. The actor model is somewhat a bit of a mix of both solutions, the difference is that actors are a like threads which don't share the same memory context. Communication between actors is done via exchanged messages ensuring that each actor handles its own state and therefore avoiding corrupt data (two threads can modify the same data at the same time, but an actor can't receive two messages at the exact same time). We'll talk about that design pattern later on, so don't worry if you are confused.</p>

<p>What about Ruby? Should Ruby developers use threads, multiple processes, actors, something else? The answer is: <strong>yes</strong>!</p>

<h2>Threads</h2>

<p>Since version 1.9, Ruby has native threads (before that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a> were used). So in theory, if we would like to, we should be able to use threads everywhere like most Java developers do. Well, that's almost true, the problem is that Ruby, like Python uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (aka GIL). This GIL is a locking mechanism that is meant to protect your data integrity. The GIL only allows data to be modified by one thread at time and therefore doesn't let threads corrupt data but also it doesn't allow them to truly run concurrently. That is why some people say that Ruby and Python are not capable of (true) concurrency.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110223-kk58iq5yjdpmyswf7nuya4c4kp.jpg" alt="Global Interpreter Lock by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>However these people often don't mention that the GIL makes single threaded programs faster, that multi-threaded programs are much easier to develop since the data structures are safe and finally that a lot of C extensions are not thread safe and without the GIL, these C extensions don't behave properly. These arguments don't convince everyone and that's why you will hear some people say you should look at another Ruby implementation without a GIL, such as <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> (hydra branch) or <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> (Rubinius &amp; MacRuby also offer other concurrency approaches). If you are using an implementation without a GIL, then using threads in Ruby has exactly the same pros/cons than doing so in Java. However, it means that now you have to deal with the nightmare of threads: making sure your data is safe, doesn't deadlock, check that your code, your libs, plugins and gems are thread safe. Also, running too many threads might affect the performance because your OS doesn't have enough resources to allocate and it ends up spending its time context switching. It's up to you to see if it's worth it for your project.</p>

<h2>Multiple processes &amp; forking</h2>

<p>That's the most commonly used solution to gain concurrency when using Ruby and Python. Because the default language implementation isn't capable of true concurrency or because you want to avoid the challenges of thread programming, you might want to just start more processes. That's really easy as long as you don't want to share states between running processes. If you wanted to do so, you would need to use <a href="http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/drb/introduction.html">DRb</a>, a message bus like <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, or a shared data store like memcached or a DB. The caveat is that you now need to use a LOT more memory. If want to run 5 Rails processes and your app uses 100Mb you will now need 500Mb, ouch that's a lot of memory! That is exactly what happens when you use a Rails webserver like Mongrel. Now some other servers like <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> and <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a> found a workaround, they rely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28operating_system%29">unix forking</a>. The advantage of forking in an unix environment implementing the copy-on-write semantics is that we create a new copy of the main process but they both "share" the same physical memory. However, each process can modify its own memory without affecting the other processes. So now, Passenger can load your 100Mb Rails app in a process, then fork this process 5 times and the total footprint will be just a bit more than 100Mb and you can now handle 5X more concurrent requests. Note that if you are allocating memory in your request processing code (read controller/view) your overall memory will grow but you can still run many more processes before running out of memory. This approach is appealing because really easy and pretty safe. If a forked process acts up or leaks memory, just destroy it and create a new fork from the master process. Note that this approach is also used in <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a>, the async job processing solution by <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This solution works well if you want to duplicate a full process like a webserver, however it gets less interesting when you just want to execute some code "in the background". Resque took this approach because by nature async jobs can yield weird results, leak memory or hang. Dealing with forks allows for an external control of the processes and the cost of the fork isn't a big deal since we are already in an async processing approach.</p>

<h2>Actors/Fibers</h2>

<p>Earlier we talked a bit about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a>. Since Ruby 1.9, developers now have access to a new type of "lightweight" threads called <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/Fiber.html">Fibers</a>. Fibers are not actors and Ruby doesn't have a native Actor model implementation but some people wrote <a href="http://doc.revactor.org/files/README.html">some actor libs</a> on top of fibers. A fiber is like a simplified thread which isn't scheduled by the VM but by the programmer. Fibers are like blocks which can be paused and resumed from the outside of from within themselves. Fibers are faster and use less memory than threads as demonstrated in <a href="http://oldmoe.blogspot.com/2008/08/ruby-fibers-vs-ruby-threads.html">this blog post</a>. However, because of the GIL, you still cannot truly run more than one concurrent fiber by thread and if you want to use multiple CPU cores, you will need to run fibers within more than one thread. So how do fibers help with concurrency? The answer is that they are part of a bigger solution. Fiber allow developers to manually control the scheduling of "concurrent" code but also to have the code within the fiber to auto schedule itself. That's pretty big because now you can wrap an incoming web request in its own fiber and tell it to send a response back when it's done doing its things. In the meantime, you can move on the to next incoming request. Whenever a request within a fiber is done, it will automatically resume itself and be returned. Sounds great right? Well, the only problem is that if you are doing any type of blocking IO in a fiber, the entire thread is blocked and the other fibers aren't running. Blocking operations are operations like database/memcached queries, http requests... basically things you are probably triggering from your controllers. The good news is that the "only" problem to fix now is to avoid blocking IOs. Let's see how to do that.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110223-8wkfs2g12p15ku18rm7aq9negf.jpg" alt="fiber" /></p>

<h2>Non blocking IOs/Reactor pattern.</h2>

<p>The reactor pattern is quite simple to understand really. The heavy work of making blocking IO calls is delegated to an external service (reactor) which can receive concurrent requests. The service handler (reactor) is given callback methods to trigger asynchronously based on the type of response received. Let me take a limited analogy to hopefully explain the design better. It's a bit like if you were asking someone a hard question, the person will take a while to reply but his/her reply will make you decide if you raise a flag or not. You have two options, or you choose to wait for the response and decide to raise the flag based on the response, or your flag logic is already defined and you tell the person what to do based on their answer and move on without having to worry about waiting for the answer. The second approach is exactly what the reactor pattern is. It's obviously slightly more complicated but the key concept is that it allows your code to define methods/blocks to be called based on the response which will come later on.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110223-xkit6utnty1sdt84n15w7dgtnh.jpg" alt="Reactor from Matt Aimonetti's blog" /></p>

<p>In the case of a single threaded webserver that's quite important. When a request comes in and your code makes a DB query, you are blocking any other requests from being processed. To avoid that, we could wrap our request in a fiber, trigger an async DB call and pause the fiber so another request can get processed as we are waiting for the DB. Once the DB query comes back, it wakes up the fiber it was trigger from, which then sends the response back to the client. Technically, the server can still only send one response at a time, but now fibers can run in parallel and don't block the main tread by doing blocking IOs (since it's done by the reactor).</p>

<p>This is the approach used by <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>, <a href="http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Deferrable.html">EventMachine</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Ruby developers can use EventMachine or an EventMachine based webserver like <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony">EM clients/drivers</a> to make non blocking async calls. Mix that with some Fiber love and you get Ruby concurrency. Be careful though, using Thin, non blocking drivers and Rails in threadsafe mode doesn't mean you are doing concurrent requests. Thin/EM only use one thread and you need to let it know that it's ok to handle the next request as we are waiting. This is done by <a href="http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Deferrable.html">deferring the response</a> and let the reactor know about it.</p>

<p>The obvious problem with this approach is that it forces you to change the way you write code. You now need to set a bunch of callbacks, understand the Fiber syntax, and use deferrable responses, I have to admit that this is kind of a pain. If you look at some Node.js code, you will see that it's not always an <a href="http://howtonode.org/control-flow-part-ii/file-write.js">elegant approach</a>. The good news tho, is that this process can be wrapped and your code can be written as it if was processed synchronously while being handled asynchronously under the covers. This is a bit more complex to explain without showing code, so this will be the topic of a future post. But I do believe that things will get much easier soon enough.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>High concurrency with Ruby is doable and done by many. However, it could made easier. Ruby 1.9 gave us fibers which allow for a more granular control over the concurrency scheduling, combined with non-blocking IO, high concurrency can be achieved. There is also the easy solution of forking a running process to multiply the processing power. However the real question behind this heated debate is what is the future of the Global Interpreter Lock in Ruby, should we remove it to improve concurrency at the cost of dealing with some new major threading issues, unsafe C extensions, etc..? Alternative Ruby implementers seem to believe so, but at the same time Rails still ships with a default mutex lock only allowing requests to be processed one at a time, the reason given being that a lot of people using Rails don't write thread safe code and a lot of plugins are not threadsafe. Is the future of concurrency something more like <a href="http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/">libdispatch</a>/<a href="http://www.macruby.org/documentation/gcd.html">GCD</a> where the threads are handled by the kernel and the developer only deals with a simpler/safer API?</p>

    <updated>2011-02-19T16:29:07+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/02/19/bridgesupport-build</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was helping someone write an Objective-C framework around <a href="http://cocos2d.org/">cocos2d</a>.</p>

<p>C/Objective-C code can be called directly from MacRuby. However the Obj-C code you would like to use might be using some ANSI C symbols that are non-object-oriented items such as constants, enumerations, structures, and functions. To make these items available to our MacRuby code, you need to generate a <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449380373/ch03.html#_using_objective_c_or_c_code">BridgeSupport file as explained in this section of my book</a>.</p>

<p>In our case, we were working on the framework and I didn't feel like manually having to regenerate the BridgeSupport file every single time I would compile our code. So instead I added a new build phase in our target.</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="741" caption="Adding a new step to our build"]<a href="https://img.skitch.com/20110220-b685ag2cef8qm69uwn73e3equ4.png"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110220-b685ag2cef8qm69uwn73e3equ4.png" alt="" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>And I added the following script to run at the end of the build:</p>

<p>`</p>

<h1>This step generated the bridgesupport file for the framework</h1>

<p>PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
mkdir -p $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME.framework/Resources/BridgeSupport/
gen_bridge_metadata --64-bit -f $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME.framework/ -o $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME.framework/Resources/BridgeSupport/$PROJECT_NAME.bridgesupport
`</p>

<p>Th<code>e script just executes the steps required to add the BridgeSupport file to your framework. I can now rebuild my framework without having to worry about BridgeSupport.

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/01/31/designing-for-scalability/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-31T13:30:55+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/01/31/designing-for-scalability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Designing beautiful and scalable software is hard. Really hard.</p>

<p>It's hard for many reasons. But what makes it even harder is that software scalability is a relatively new challenge, something only really done in big companies, companies that are not really keen on sharing their knowledge. The amount of academic work done on software design is quite limited compared to other types of design, but shared knowledge about scalable design is almost nonexistent <em>(Don't expect to find detailed information about scaling online video games either, the industry is super secretive. And even if this is a niche market where finding skilled/experienced developers is really challenging, information is not shared outside a game project).</em></p>

<p>I don't pretend to have the required knowledge to cover this topic at length. However, I do have some exposure and figured I should share what I learned so others can benefit from my experience and push the discussion further.</p>

<p>Designing scalable software is just like any other type of software design, with a few unique constraints. If I had to define the key requirements of a great design I would have to quote Frederick P. Brooks:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Great designs have conceptual integrity - unity, economy, clarity"</p></blockquote>

<p>This is true for any type of design and one should always start by that.
Don't just jump on your keyboard and start writing tests/code right away. Take a minute to think about your design.
That will save you hours of refactoring and headaches.</p>

<h2>You're a designer and might not even know it</h2>

<p>You might not be designing the next NASA engine but you are more than likely designing an API that you and others will use. As a matter of fact, unless you write code that will never be seen again, you are writing an Application Programming Interface (API). Every single class, method, function you write is an API that you and others will use. Remember that every time you write code, you are the implementer of a design, and therefore you are a designer.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_916" align="alignright" width="150" caption="Giana and I, discussing design patterns"]<a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/31/designing-for-scalability/giana_and_moi_lowres/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/giana_and_moi_lowres-150x150.jpg" alt="Giana and Matt Aimonetti" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>When thinking about your design, focus on design concepts instead of implementation details. A design concept must be clear, simple to both explain with words and draw on a whiteboard. If you can't draw and explain your design on a whiteboard, you have failed one of the great design requirement: clarity. If you work alone, or your coworkers are tired of hearing you, try rubber ducking your design ideas. It's the same concept as rubber ducking debugging, where a programmer would force himself to explain his code, line-by-line, to a rubber duck on his desk but instead of talking about the code, explain your design and why it's awesome (I've recently done this with my baby girl and it's been really helpful).</p>

<h2>Keeping the design integrity</h2>

<p>One of the challenges of designing scalable software is that your constraints are often very unique to your product. Off the shelf solutions don't work for you, and the specific solution used by another project can't be transposed to your project because the cause and the effect of what you need to scale are different. The problem is that you really quickly lose design integrity.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at a concrete example to see how the design integrity can be lost or even not defined at all.
Let's pretend we want to write a suite of web APIs for video games.</p>

<p>We can look at this task from different perspectives:<a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/31/designing-for-scalability/the-shout-2/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/the-shout1-150x150.jpg" alt="the shout posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Video game deadlines are crazy, let's find a way to release as many APIs ASAP.</p></li>
<li><p>We're going to get a huge amount of traffic, let's make sure we don't crash and burn.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to make sure our APIs are simple to use for the dev teams integrating them.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these perspectives reflects a facet of the challenge. Other facets exist that I didn't mention but that a business person might have listed right away, one of which being: How can we do that for the least amount of money?</p>

<p>To design our API suite, we first need to understand the different perspectives. Gaining this understanding will help us design something better but it will also help us communicate better with the different stakeholders. Once we have a decent understanding of the constraints and expectations, someone needs to explicitly define the design values and their priorities. This is a crucial step in the design process. Systems nowadays are too complicated to be handled by only one person and keeping design integrity requires clear communication.</p>

<h2>Design goal and values</h2>

<p>The best way to communicate the design is to write a simple sentence defining the primary goal:
"Build a robust, efficient and flexible middleware solution leveraged by external teams to develop online video game features."</p>

<p>This is a bit like the mission statement of your project, or the elevator pitch you give someone that asks you what you are working on.</p>

<p>Associated with the primary goal are a host of desiderata, or secondary objectives. These are the key objectives used to weigh technical decisions. It's important for the design to highlight a scale of values so one can refer to them to decide if his/her idea fits the design or not. Here is an example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stability</p></li>
<li><p>Performance / Scalability</p></li>
<li><p>Encapsulation / Modularity</p></li>
<li><p>Conventions</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Reusability / Maintainability</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Often these desiderata are applied to most of your projects and reflect your team/company's technical values. The list might seem simple and unnecessary but, believe me, it will reduce the arguments where John tells Jane that her idea sucks but his is better because he "knows better". Having an objective reference to refer to when trying to decide which is the best way to go is greatly valuable and will reduce the amount of office drama.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>Finally, make sure to explicitly define all the major constraints and to acknowledge the team's concerns. Here is a small example of what could be listed (which also reflect the previously mentioned perspectives):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>hard deadlines</p></li>
<li><p>external teams involved</p></li>
<li><p>huge load expected</p></li>
<li><p>limited support available</p></li>
<li><p>requirements changing quickly</p></li>
<li><p>limited budget</p></li>
<li><p>unknown hosting architecture/constraints</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that design is always iterative because the constraints keep changing. That's just the way it is and a lot of technical constraints only appear as you implement or test your design. That's also why the design needs to be clear but the implementation needs to be flexible.</p>

<h2>Reads vs writes</h2>

<p>Most of the web apps out there are read heavy, meaning that the stored data gets more accessed than modified. Scaling these type of systems is easier as one can introduce a cache layer, an intermediary storage, which acts as a fast buffer that avoids putting load on the backends. The cost reduction is huge because if you architected your app properly, the data is read from the data store only once (or once every X minutes) after being created/modified.</p>

<p>Caching is so important that it's even built into the HTTP protocol, making caching trivial.
Speaking of HTTP, a common problem I often see when serving http content to a browser is that even though the backend calls are the same, some information needs to be customized for the current visitor. This prevents it from caching the entire page. An easy solution in this case is to still cache the entire page but to use javascript to fetch the custom data from the backend and to modify the cached http at the client's browser level directly. As part of your design, you will more than likely need to implement multiple layers of caching and use technologies such as query caching, Varnish, Squid, Memcached, memoization, etc...</p>

<p>The problem is that, as your system gets more traffic, you will notice that the volume of DB/network writes becomes your bottleneck. You will also notice a reduction of your cache/hit ratio because only a small part of your cached data is often retrieved by many clients. At this point, you will need to denormalize to avoid contention, shard your data in silos, or write to cache and flush from cache when the data store is available and not overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous processing</h2>

<p>One way to avoid write contention is to use async processing. The concept is simple. Instead of directly writing to your datastore after your backend receives a request, you put a message in a queue with all the information needed to run the operation later. On the other side, you have a set number of workers receiving messages and operating on them one after the other.</p>

<p>The advantage of such an approach is that you control the amount of workers and therefore the amount of maximum concurrent writes to your datastore. You can also process the queue before it gets worked and and maybe coalesce some messages or remove outdated/duplicated message. Finally, you can assign more workers to some message types, making sure the important messages get processed first.</p>

<p>Another advantage of this design includes not letting the client hang while you're processing the data and potentially timeout. You can also process a long queue faster by starting more workers to catch up and retire them later.
You app is more resilient to errors and failed async jobs can be restarted.</p>

<h2>Load test, monitor and be proactive</h2>

<p>Even the best designs have weak spots and will have to be improved once they are released. Don't wait for your system to fall apart before looking for solutions. Monitor your app. Every single part of your app. Look for patterns showing signs of potential problems and imagine what you could do to resolve them if they would start manifesting.</p>

<p>Of course before getting there, you will need to understand each part of your system and benchmark/load test/profile your app so you can be ready to face the storm.</p>

<p>Benchmarks and load tests are both super important and, too often, not reflective of what you will really face later on. They are usually great at identifying major problems that should be resolved right away, but fail to show the one big problem you will see on day one when you have to deal with 20k concurrent requests. Use them as indicators, rely on your experience and learn about problems other have faced. This will help you build a knowledge of scalability challenges, their root causes, and their potential solutions.</p>

<p>For benchmarking Ruby code, I use the<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/classes/Benchmark.html"> built-in benchmark tool available in the standard lib</a>.
For simple load testing, I use <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a>/<a href="http://www.xenoclast.org/autobench/">autobench</a> and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/siege/">siege</a>.
For anything more complicated, I use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a>.
In the video game industry, we also often use sims using the client's code to create load.</p>

<p>Benchmarking without profiling is often useless. Unlike other programming languages, Ruby doesn't yet have awesome profiling tools easy to use, but things are evolving quickly. Here are some tools I use regularly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb">Ruby wrapper</a> around <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/">google perftools</a> is really good.
Before using perftools as often as I do now, I frequently used <a href="http://ruby-prof.rubyforge.org/">ruby-prof</a> with <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html">kcachegrind</a>.
Ruby 1.9 lets you inspect its garbage collector as explained in a <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/07/29/object-allocation-why-you-should-care/">previous post</a>.
And when using <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a>, I often use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a>.</p>

<h2>Other misc. things I learned</h2>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Documentation is critical. It doesn't matter how you do it but you need to make sure you document what you want to build, how you build it, and why you build it. Documenting will help you and the others working on the project, and will keep you in check. I have started documenting an API and then realized that the design was flawed. Maybe it's just the way you name a method, or a class, or it can be a weird method signature or even the entire workflow being wrong, but when you document things, design errors appear more obviously.</p>

<p>To document Ruby code, I use <a href="http://yardoc.org/">yard</a> which is quite similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">javadoc</a>. Code documentation, when writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck typed language</a>, is, for me, very important since it makes the API designer's expectations much clearer. I also often add English documentation, written in markdown files and compiled by yard. If you say that your code is simple and that it doesn't require documentation because anyone can just read it and understand ... then you have totally miss the point. Yes, it's more work to keep documentation and code in sync. But people using web APIs don't have access to the implementation details. The people distributing compiled APIs don't give access to their implementation. And honestly, the API should be decoupled from the implementation. I shouldn't have to guess how to use your API based on how you implemented the code underneath, otherwise my assumptions might be totally wrong.</p>

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility. The law of system entropy says that systems become more disorganized over time, so don't start with complicated code if you can avoid it! It's not because your programming language lets you do crazy stuff that you have to use it. In 90+% of the time, your code can be written without voodoo and be easier to read, easier to understand, easier to maintain and faster to execute.</p>

<p>If you can't figure out how to <strong><em>not</em></strong> use metaprogramming or weird patterns, take a step back and look at your design, did you miss something?
Also, don't reinvent the wheel. Use the language the way it was designed to be used. Keep your APIs as small as possible, don't expose too much as it will be virtually impossible to remove it later on.</p>

<p>As an example, look to what extent Rails modified the Ruby language:</p>

<p>In Rails' console (Rails 2, Ruby 1.8.7)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Array.ancestors
=&gt; [Array, ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::RandomAccess,
 ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::Grouping, ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::ExtractOptions,
 ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::Conversions, ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::Access,
 Enumerable, Object, ERB::Util, ActiveSupport::Dependencies::Loadable, Base64::Deprecated, Base64,
 Kernel]
&gt;&gt; [].methods.size
=&gt; 233
</code></pre>

<p>In irb:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Array.ancestors
=&gt; [Array, Enumerable, Object, Kernel]
&gt;&gt; [].methods.size
=&gt; 149
</code></pre>

<p>Removing any of these added methods is virtually impossible since some piece of code somewhere might rely on it.</p>

<h3>Abstraction &amp; its dangers</h3>

<p>Often when designing an API, it's preferable to offer a well defined  public API which will delegate the work to a private implementation shared between  multiple public APIs. This approach avoids duplication, makes maintenance easy, and  allows for more flexibility. As an example, we can have a public  matchmaking API which will delegate most of the work to a private  matchmaking interface. If required, swapping the private interface would be  totally transparent to the public API. This approach has a downside, however. Having a shared private implementation does create a duplication of APIs. It leaves us with both a public and a private API because we need an API for public access and a private API for the public API to connect to. But when we weigh the  benefits and look at what is duplicated, we realize that this trade off  is worth it.</p>

<p>Keeping a certain level of abstraction is important to maintaining the separation of concerns as clear as possible. You want to layer your design so that each  layer is responsible for itself, only knows about itself, and has limited  interactions with other layers. By factoring/isolating the different  modules, you can keep a simple, elegant, easy to maintain system. This  is a key element of design but one needs to be careful not to obfuscate  the design by over abstracting his/her code. This is particularly important when designing a scalable app because you will often need to be able to easily swap parts  to optimize each part of your system.</p>

<p>That said, a lot of code out there is unnecessarily complicated. I sometime wonder if the authors of such code try to show that they know some cool language tricks. Or maybe this is due to the fact that, too often, people are impressed by code they don't understand. The problem with overly complicated or magical code is that it creates yet another abstraction layer between the end user and API. It makes the API more opaque, and that's a cost you have to take into consideration. Every time you abstract something you have a cost associated with the abstraction. This cost can be calculated in terms of performance loss, clarity loss and maintainability cost.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same problem encountered when trying to normalize data in a database.
Normalizing is a great concept which makes a lot of sense ... until you realize that the cost of keeping your data normalized is too great and it becomes a major bottleneck, not letting you scale your application.
At this moment (and probably only then) that you need to denormalize your data.</p>

<p>It's the same thing with code abstraction. It's fine to abstract, unless the abstraction is such that it requires too much work to understand what is going on. A bit of duplication is often worth it, but be careful to not abuse it.</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Ruby has a decent debugger called <a href="http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/ruby-debug.html">ruby-debug</a> and I'm amazed by the amount of people who haven't heard about it.
I don't know what I would do if I couldn't use breakpoints and get an interactive shell to debug Ruby code.
Please people! This is 2011, stop using print statement as a means of debugging!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That's is for this post. It was longer than expected and I feel I didn't really cover anything in depth, but hopefully you learned something new or at least read something that piqued your interest. I look forward to reading your comments and, hopefully, your blog posts sharing your experience in designing scalable software.</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2011/01/18/causality-of-scalability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part of my job at <a href="http://us.playstation.com/">Sony PlayStation</a> is to architect scalable systems which can handle a horde of excited players eager to be the first to play the latest awesome game and who would play for 14-24 hours straight. In other words, I need to make sure a system can "scale". In my case, a scalable system is a system that can go from a few hundred concurrent users/players to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users/players and stay stable for months.</p>

<p>One can achieve scalability in many ways, and if you expect me to provide you with a magical formula you will be disappointed. I actually believe that you can scale almost anything if you have the adequate resources. So saying that X or Y doesn't scale is for me a sign that people are taking shortcuts in their explanations (X or Y are really hard to scale so they don't scale) or that they don't understand the causality of scaling. However what I am exploring in this post is the relationship between cause and effect when trying to make a system scalable. We will see that the scalability challenge is not new and not exclusive to the tech world. We will study the traditional approach to scaling and as well as the challenge of scaling in relation to the web and what to be aware of when planning to make a solution scalable.</p>

<h2>Scaling outside of the tech world</h2>

<p>Trying to scale isn't new. It goes back to well before technology was invented. Scaling something up or increasing something in size or number is a goal businesses have aimed for ever since the oldest profession in the world was invented. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/EN_BESKYTTERINDE_AF_INDUSTRIEN.gif/180px-EN_BESKYTTERINDE_AF_INDUSTRIEN.gif" alt="" />A prostitute wanting to scale up her business was limited by her own time and body. She would reach a point where she couldn't take more clients. (Independent contractors surely know what I am talking about!) So a prostitute wanting to scale up would usually become a madam/Mama-san and scale the business by having girls work for her.</p>

<p>Another simple example would be a restaurant. A restaurant can handle up to a certain amount of covers/clients at once, after that, customers have to wait in line. The restaurant example is interesting because you can clearly see that opening a huge restaurant with a capacity of 1,000 covers might not be a good idea. First because the cost of running such a restaurant might be much more than the income generated. But also because even though the restaurant does 1,000 covers at peak time, it doesn't mean that the restaurant will stay that busy during the entire time it's open. So now you have to deal with waiter/waitresses, busboys and other staff who won't have anything to do. As you probably have understood already, scaling a restaurant means that the scaling has to be done in a cost effective manner.  And what's even more interesting is that what we could have thought was the bottleneck (the amount of concurrent covers) can be easily scaled up but it wouldn't provide real scalability. In fact this choice would cascade into other areas of management like staffing and the building size. Often, the scaling solution for restaurants is to open new locations which can result in keeping the lines shorter, targeting new markets and reducing risks since one failing branch won't dramatically affect the others.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Nighthawks.jpg/400px-Nighthawks.jpg" alt="posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<h2>Scaling in the traditional tech world</h2>

<p>If you've ever done console development or worked on embedded devices, you know that they are restricted by some key elements. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/PS3Versions.png/220px-PS3Versions.png" alt="posted by Matt Aimonetti" />It can be memory, CPU, hard drive space etc... You have to "cram" as many features as you can into the device, working around the fixed limitations of the hardware. In the console industry, what's interesting to note is that the hardware doesn't change often but people expect than a new game on the same platform will do things better than the previous game, even though the limitations are exactly the same. This is quite a challenging problem because you have to fight against the hardware limitations by optimizing your code to be super efficient. That's exactly the reason why console video game developers manage memory manually instead of relying on a garbage collector. This way they can squeeze every resource they can from the console.</p>

<p>The great advantage of this type of development is that you can reproduce and accurately anticipate issues. The bottlenecks/limitations are well known and immutable! If you find a way around in your lab, you know that the solution will work for everyone. Console video game developers (and to some extent, iOS developers) don't have to wonder how their game will behave if the player has an old graphic card or not enough RAM.</p>

<p>But ever since we started distributing the processing power, scaling technology has become more challenging.</p>

<h2>Scaling on the web</h2>

<p>Scaling a web based solution might actually seem quite like scaling a restaurant, except that you can't easily open multiple locations since the concept of proximity in web browsing isn't really as concrete as in real life. So the solution can't be directly transposed. Most people will only have to scale up by optimizing their code running on one server, or maybe two. That's because their service/app is not, and won't be, generating high traffic. Scaling such systems is common and one can rely on work done in the past decades for good examples of solutions.</p>

<p>However some web apps/games are or will become high traffic. But because every single entrepreneur I've met believes that their solution will be high traffic, they think they need to be able to scale and therefore should be engineered like that from the beginning. (This is, by the way, the reason scalability is a buzzword and you can sell almost anything technical saying that it scales.) The problem with this approach is that people want scalability but don't understand its causality. In other words, they don't understand the relationship between cause and effect related to making a solution scalable.</p>

<p>Basically we can reduce the concept of causality of scalability to something like this: you change a piece of the architecture to handle more traffic, but this part has an effect on other parts that also need to change and the pursuit of scalability almost never ends (just ask Google). <strong>Making a system scalable needs to have well a defined cause and expected effect, otherwise it's a waste</strong>. In other words, the effect of scaling engenders the need for solutions which themselves have complex effects on a lot of aspects of a system. Let's make it clearer by looking at a simple example:</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/18/causality-of-scalability/simplestarchitecture/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/simplestarchitecture-300x269.png" alt="Simple Architecture by Matt Aimonetti" /></a>We have an e-commerce website and this website uses a web application with a database to store products and transactions. Your system is made of 1 webserver handling the requests and one database storing the data. Everything goes well until Black Friday, Christmas or Mother's Day arrives and now some customers are complaining that they can't access your website or that it's too slow. This is also sometimes referred to as the digg/slashdot/reddit effect. All of a sudden you have a peak of traffic and your website can't handle it. This is actually a very simple use case, but that's also the only use case most people on the web need to worry about.</p>

<p>The causality of wanting this solution to scale is simple, you want to scale so you can sell more and have happy customers. The effect is that the system needs to become more complex.</p>

<p>To scale such a system, you need to find the root cause of the problem. You might have a few issues, but start by focusing on the main one. In this case, it's more than likely that your webserver (frontend) cannot handle more than x requests/second. Interestingly enough, the amount of reqs/s might not match the result of your load tests. That's probably because you didn't expect the usage pattern that you are seeing, but that's a whole different topic. At this point you need to understand why you can't go above the x reqs/s limit you're hitting. Where is the bottleneck? Is it that your application code is too slow? Is it the database has been brought to its knees? Or maybe the webserver serves as many requests as technically possible but it's still not enough based on the traffic you are getting.</p>

<p>If we stop right here, we can see that the reasons why the solution doesn't scale can be multiple. But what's even more interesting is that the root cause this time depends on the usage pattern and that it is really hard to anticipate all patterns. If we wanted to make this system scale we could do it different ways.</p>

<p>To give you some canned answers, if the bottleneck is that your code is too slow, you should check if the code is slow because of the DB queries made (too many, slow queries etc..). Is it slow because you are doing something complex that can't be easily improved or is it because you are relying on solutions that are known to not support concurrent traffic easily? More than likely, you will end up going for the easy caching approach. By caching some data (full responses, chunk of data, partial responses etc..) you avoid hitting your application layer and therefore can handle more traffic.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_879" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Caching avoids data processing &amp; DB access "]<a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/18/causality-of-scalability/simplestarchitecture3/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/simplestarchitecture3-300x201.png" alt="More complex Architecture by Matt Aimonetti" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>If your code is as fast as it can be, then a solution is to add more application servers or to async some processes. But now that means that you need to change the topology of your system, the way you deploy code and the way you route traffic. You will also increase the load on the database by opening more connections and maybe the database will now becoming the new bottleneck. You might also start seeing race conditions and you are certainly increasing the maintenance and complexity aka cost of your system (caching might end up having the same effect depending on the caching solution chosen).</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_876" align="aligncenter" width="297" caption="One way of scaling it to load balance the traffic"]<a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/18/causality-of-scalability/simplestarchitecture2/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/simplestarchitecture2-297x300.png" alt="load balanced approach by Matt Aimonetti" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Just looking at these possible causes and the various solutions (we didn't even mention DB replication, sharding, NoSQL etc..), we can clearly see that making a system scalable has some concrete effects on system complexity/maintenance which directly translate in cost increase.</p>

<p>If you are an engineer, you obviously want your system to be super scalable and handle millions of requests per second. But if you are a business person, you want to be realistic and evaluate the causality of not scaling after a certain point and convert that as loss. Then you weigh the cost of not scaling with the cost of "maybe" scaling and you make a decision.</p>

<p>The problem here though is that scaling is a bit like another buzzword: SEO (Search Engine Optimization). A lot of people/solutions will promise scaling capabilities without really understanding the big picture. Simple systems can easily scale up using simple solutions but only up to a certain level. After that, what you need to do to scale becomes so complex than anyone promising you the moon probably doesn't know what they are talking about. If there was a one-size-fits-all, easy solution for scaling, we would all be using it, from your brother for his blog, to Google without forgetting Amazon.</p>

<p><img src="http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/logo_aws.gif" alt="AWS logo posted by Matt Aimonetti" />Speaking of Amazon, I hear a lot of people saying that Amazon AWS services is "THE WAY" (i.e: the only way) to scale your applications. I agree that it's a compelling solution for a lot of cases but it's far from being a silver bullet. Remember that the cause and effect of why you need to scale are probably different than anyone else.</p>

<h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>

<p>Let me give you a very concrete example of where <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS services</a> might<em> not</em> be a good idea: high traffic sites with lots of database writes and low latency.</p>

<p><a href="http://zynga.com">Zynga</a>, the famous social game company behind Farmville, Mafia Wars etc., is using AWS and it seems that they might have found themselves in the same scenario as above<img src="http://www.zynga.com/img/logo.png" alt="" />. And that would be almost correct. Zynga games have huge traffic and they do a ton of DB writes. However I don't think they need low latency since their game clients are browsers and Flash clients and that their games are mainly async so they just need to be able to handle unstable latency. We'll see in a second how they manage to perform on the AWS cloud.</p>

<p>The major problem with AWS when you have a high traffic site is IO: IO reliability, IO latency, IO availability. By IO, I'm referring to network connection (internal/external) and disk access. Put differently, when you design your system and you know you are going to run on AWS, you need to take into consideration that your solution should survive with zero or limited IO because you will more than likely be IO bound. This means that your traditional design won't work because your database hard drive won't be available for 30s or will be totally saturated. You also need to have a super redundant system because you are going to randomly lose machines. Point number one, moving your existing application from a dedicated hosting solution to AWS might not help you scale if you didn't architect to be resilient to bad IO. Simply put, and to only pick one example: if you were expecting your database to be able to always properly write to disk you will have problems.</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="184" caption="Octocat, the GitHub mascot"]<img src="http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/github-logo.png" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>The solution depends on how you want to look at it and where you are at in your project. You can go the <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/2/8/how-farmville-scales-to-harvest-75-million-players-a-month.html">Zynga route and design/redesign your entire architecture to be highly redundant, not rely on disk access</a> (everything is kept in memory and flushed to disk when available) and tolerate a certain % of data loss. Or you can go with the<a href="https://github.com/blog/493-github-is-moving-to-rackspace"> GitHub approach</a><a href="https://github.com/blog/493-github-is-moving-to-rackspace"> and mix dedicated hardware for IO and "cloud" front end servers all on the same network</a>. One solution isn't better than the other, they are just different and depend on your needs. <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://www.zynga.com/">Zynga</a> both need to scale but they have different requirements.</p>

<p>When it comes to scaling, things are not black or white. To stay on the AWS topic, let's take another example: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Earlier today, I was complaining on Twitter that RDS doesn't and probably won't let you use the <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html">MySQL HandlerSocket plugin</a> any time soon, even though it's been released for almost 6 months and used in prod by many. Then someone asked me if using this plugin would offset the scalability cost-saving. The quick and wrong answer  is yes. By using the plugin, you can potentially get rid of your Memcached servers, probably your Redis/MongoDB/CouchDB servers or whatever NoSQL solution you write and just keep the database servers you currently have. You might have to beef up your DB servers a bit but it would certainly be a huge cost reduction and your system would be simpler, easier to maintain and the data would be more consistent. Sounds good right? After all the biggest online social game company designed it and uses it.</p>

<p>The only problem is that RDS is an AWS service and like every AWS service, it suffers from poor IO. So, if you were deciding to not use RDS and run your own MySQL servers with the HandlerSocket plugin, it wouldn't bring you much improvement <em>(1)</em>. Actually, if you are already IO bound, it would make things worse, because you are centralizing your system around the most unreliable part of your architecture. Based on that premise, RDS won't support HandlerSocket because RDS runs on the same AWS architecture and has to deal with the same IO constraints. What's the solution, you might ask? Amazon already went through these scaling problems and they offer a custom, non-relational, data storage solution working around their own issues called SimpleDB. But why would they improve RDS and fix a really hard problem when they already offer an alternative solution? Easy. SimpleDB forces you to redesign your architecture to work with their custom solution and, guess what? You are now locked-in to that vendor!</p>

<p>So the answer is yes, you can offset scalability costs if you don't use AWS or any other providers with bad IO. Now you should look at the cost of moving away from AWS and see if it's worth it. How much of your code and of your system is vendor specific? Is that something you can easily change? The <a href="https://github.com/geemus/fog">fog library</a>, for instance, supports multiple cloud providers. Are you using something similar? Can you transition to that?  Can you easily deploy to another hosting company? (<a href="http://opscode.com/chef">Opscode chef</a> makes that task much easier) But if, for one reason or another, you have to stick with AWS/<other cloud provider>, make sure that the business people in charge understand the consequences and the cost related to that choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>My point is not to tell you to not design a scalable solution, or not to use AWS, or that RDS sucks. My point is to show that making a system scale is hard and has some drastic effects that are not always obvious. There aren't any silver bullet solutions and you need to be really careful about the consequences (and costs) involved with trying to scale. Make sure it's worth it and you have a plan. Define measurable goals for your scalability even though it's really hard, don't try to scale to infinity and beyond, that won't work. Having to redesign later on to handle even more traffic, is a good problem to have, don't over engineer.</p>

<p>Finally, be careful to understand the consequences of your decisions. What seems to be an almost trivial scaling move such as moving your app from dedicated hosting to a specific cloud provider might end up getting you in a vendor lock in situation!</p>

<p><em>1: I assume that you are IO bound. If you are not and your DB data fits in memory/cache, then HS on AWS is fine but if that's the case what's your bottleneck? ;)</em></p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/11/12/rubyconf-2010-macruby-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year I gave the traditional Apple's MacRuby talk at RubyConf.
My presentation focused on 2 axis:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What's new since last RubyConf</p></li>
<li><p>Show some examples of how fun it is to hack with MacRuby</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/macruby-rubyconf-presentation-2010">Macruby - RubyConf Presentation 2010</a></strong></p>

<p>View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti">Matt Aimonetti</a>.</p>

<p>MacRuby is currently at version 0.7.1 and version 0.8 is in preparation.
Since last new a lot of things happened, here is a quick summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cocoa dev is now considered stable.  Apple gave its seal of approval, most of the bugs are fixed and it's currently used on production projects and some apps were even submitted to the Mac App Store.</p></li>
<li><p>Ahead of Time compilation. This is quite a major improvement with many repercussions. Being to compile your Ruby source code means faster boot time and source obfuscation. Two major things to consider when you want to ship a desktop app.</p></li>
<li><p>Debugger. MacRuby now ships with its own debugger. Of course you can still use GDB and DTrace, but MacRuby's debugger is really easy to use and very powerful.</p></li>
<li><p>Grand Central Dispatch support and wrapper API. Having to manage threads can be hard for both developers and for the machines having to run the developer code. GCD is an abstraction layer allowing developers to only focus on business logic without having to worry about the underlying details if you don't want to. The end result is an optimum use of all the cores available on a machine and truly concurrent code. Two important notions when writing desktop apps.</p></li>
<li><p>ControlTower - A webserver for Rack apps written in MacRuby and using GCD for concurrency.</p></li>
<li><p>New rewritten and more efficient dispatcher. Practically that means that the dispatcher is now thread safe with a per thread cache.</p></li>
<li><p>RegExp lib switch from Oniguruma to ICU. This was quite a big change and it was required because Oniguruma isn't thread safe and while C Ruby uses a Global Interpreter Lock. MacRuby on the other hand uses native POSIX threads running on their own non-locking, reentrant VM making thread safety critical.</p></li>
<li><p>More solid foundations - Some key classes we rewritten to improve performance and flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for C blocks - Objective-C has been supporting C blocks for a while and some Cocoa APIs require the use of blocks. MacRuby now allows you to use Ruby blocks and to pass them as C blocks. (new BridgeSupport required)</p></li>
<li><p>Sandboxing - For safety reasons, MacRuby allows you to now sandbox your applications. You can restrict your app from doing some potential dangerous things such as writing to disk, calling the system, accessing internet etc...</p></li>
<li><p>Mac App Store - This is not something done by the MacRuby team. But it directly affects MacRuby developers wanting to distribute their applications. Think about the exposure that you can app can have. Even if you have a web app, you can use WebKit to wrap it up, hook up a notification, add to that a local backup solution and geo location. Brilliant way to provide an even better user experience and better product exposure. All that really easily if you already know Ruby.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To give an idea of what can be done I showed some code samples hopefully showing the cool hacking things one can play with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first demo shows how to use the speech recognizer. The example is really sample you speak the name of someone and his/her picture shows up on screen. Just a few lines of code and you can start screaming commands to your TV to get it to change channel.</p></li>
<li><p>The second demo is an extremely simple Gowala client using CoreLocation. Yes, Mac desktop and laptops support geo location.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example of what you do is a sample letting you import all your twitter followers to your address book.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also use some of the low level OS features such as the Tokenizer. The next example showed how to extend Ruby and use a C function to detect the language of a string.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the last demo shows how to integrate a bluetooth device to control a HTML view via MacRuby and Javascript. All that in just a few lines of code!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, MacRuby is now mature and it's time for hackers and people trying to get exposure to give it a try.</p>

    <updated>2010-10-19T00:05:37+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/10/19/macruby-webkit-and-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was working on a piece of code using MacRuby, Webkit and JavaScript. Calling JS from MacRuby is really straight forward but calling Ruby from JS is a but tricky. There is actually a known bug in MacRuby which was giving me a hard time. The bug should be fixed in 0.8 if everything goes according to plan. In the mean time here is a quick run down:</p>

<p>The JS bridge only works when using WebKit so we need to create a tiny browser to test our code. What we are going to do is to make an object available via JS and also trigger some JS to test the bridge both ways. Here is the full code:</p>

<p>On the object we want to make available via JS (instance of Cat), we have to make the methods available by defining def self.isSelectorExcludedFromWebScript(sel); false end</p>

<p>To trigger JS from Ruby, we use #evaluateWebScript on windowScriptObject. In our example we are using JQuery since it's already loaded in the DOM. We also go full loop by printing out the result of JS calling a method on our Ruby object.</p>

<p>Here is the thing, MacRuby doesn't have the age method compiled/registered yet so JS can't call it. To fix this problem we force the registration of the method by doing: @kitty.respondsToSelector("age").  Note that if #age was taking arguments, we would have to use @kitty.respondsToSelector("age:") and then evaluate the JS like that: @js_engine.evaluateWebScript('animal.age_(12)')</p>

<p>Hopefully by the time you need to do something like that, MacRuby 0.8 will be released and you won't have to worry about that :)</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/08/22/discussion-with-a-java-switcher/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-22T17:18:55+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/08/22/discussion-with-a-java-switcher</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past 6 months, I have had regular discussions with an experienced Java developers who switched to Ruby a couple years ago. Names have been changed to protect the guilty but to help you understand my friend 'Duke' better, you need to know that he has been a developer for 10 years and lead many complicated, high traffic projects. He recently released two Ruby on Rails projects and he has been fighting with performance issues and scalability challenges.</p>

<p>Duke is a happy Ruby developer but he sometimes has a hard time understanding why things are done in a certain way in the Ruby community. Here are some extracts from our conversations. My answers are only based on my own experience and limited knowledge. They are probably not shared by the entire  community, feel free to use the comment section if you want to add more or share your own answers.</p>

<h2>Threads / Concurrency</h2>

<p><strong>Duke:</strong> Why does the Ruby community hate threads so much. It seems to be a taboo discussion and the only answer I hear is that threads are hard to deal with and that Ruby does not have a good threading implementation. What's the deal there? If you want concurrent processing, threads are important!</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> This is a very good question and I think there are two main reasons why threads and thread safety are not hot topics in the Ruby world. First, look at Ruby's main implementation itself. If you are using an old version of Ruby (pre Ruby 1.9) you don't use native threads but green threads mapping to only 1 native thread. Ilya has a great (yet a bit old) <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2008/11/13/concurrency-is-a-myth-in-ruby/">blog post explaining the difference</a>, why it matters and also the role and effect of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Also, even though Rubyists like to say that they live in the edge, most of them still use Ruby 1.8 and therefore don't really see the improvements in Ruby 1.9 nor yet understand the potential of <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/Fiber.html">fibers</a>.</p>

<p>The other part of the explanation is that the Rails community never really cared until recently. Yehuda Katz recently wrote a <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/08/14/threads-in-ruby-enough-already/">good article on thread safety</a> in Ruby and if you read his post and <a href="http://dpaste.de/5xyG/raw/">Zed Shaw's comment</a> you will understand a bit better the historical background. As a matter of fact, the current version of Rails is not multi-threaded by default and developers interested in handling concurrent requests in one process should <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Configuration.html#M002069">turn on this option</a>. Thread safety appeared for the first time in Rails 2.2 but from what I saw, most people still don't enable this option. There are many reasons for that. First, enabling thread safety disables some Rails features like automatic dependency loading after boot and code reloading. A lot of Rails developers take these two features for granted and don't understand that they are technically "hacks" to make their lives easier. I do believe a lot of Rails developers don't understand how threads, thread safety, concurrency, blocking IO and dependencies work. They care about getting their app done and meet their deadlines. They usually use and know Rails without paying too much attention to how Rails extends Ruby. Imagine what would happen if their code wasn't thread safe and Rails wasn't not using a global lock by default. Now you see why things are not exactly as you expect and also why some Rubyists are getting excited about new projects like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> which takes a different approach.</p>

<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that at least 90 to 95% of the Rails apps out there don't get more than a dozen requests/second (a million requests/day). You can scale that kind of load pretty easily using simple approaches like caching,  optimize your DB queries, load balancing to a couple servers. As a matter of fact, compared to the amount of people using Rails on a daily basis, only a very little amount of people are struggling with performance and scalability like you do. This is not an excuse but that explains why these people don't care about the things you care about.</p>

<h2>Rails is slow</h2>

<p><strong>Duke:</strong> I don't understand why Rails developers are not more concerned about the speed/performance penalty induced by Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Again, Rails is fast enough for the large majority of developers out there. As you know, as a developer you have to always make compromises. The Rails team always said that development time is more expensive than servers and therefore the focus is on making development easier, faster and more enjoyable. However to get there, they have to somewhat sacrifice some performance. What can be totally unacceptable for you is totally fine for others and your contribution is always welcome. This is probably the root cause of the things you don't like in Rails. Rails was built for startups, by startup developers and you don't fall in this category. People contributing new features and fixes are the people using Rails for what it is designed to do. There is no real 'Enterprise' support behind Rails and that might be why you feel the way you feel. Since you find yourself questioning some key Rails conventions and you are struggling with missing features, it looks  to me that you chose the wrong tool for the job since you don't even use 70% of the Rails features and are dreaming of things such 3 tier architecture. <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> might be a better fit for you if you want lower level control, less conventions and less built-in features.</p>

<h2>Object allocation / Garbage Collection</h2>

<p><strong>Duke:</strong> I recently read that Twitter was spending <a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2009/10/21/object-allocations-on-the-web/">20% of its request cycles in the GC</a>, am I the only finding that concerning?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Most people don't realize how the GC works and what it means to allocate objects since Ruby does that automatically. But at the same time, most of these people don't really see the affect of the Garbage Collection since they don't have that much traffic or they scale in ways that just skips their Ruby stack entirely. (Or they just blame Ruby for being slow)</p>

<p>If you are app deals with mainly reads/GET requests, using HTTP caching (Rails has that built-in) and something like Varnish/<a href="http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/">Rack-cache</a> will dramatically reduce the load on your server apps. Others don't investigate their issues and just add more servers. As mentioned in a <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/07/29/object-allocation-why-you-should-care/">previous post</a>, some libraries like Builder are allocating LOTS more objects than others (Nokogiri), use the existing debugging tools to see where your object allocations occur and try to fix/workaround these. In other words, Ruby's GC isn't great but by ignoring its limitations, we made things even worse. My guess is that the GC is going to improve (other implementations already have better GCs) and that people will realize that Ruby is not magic and critical elements need to be improved.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p><strong>Duke:</strong> I really have a hard time finding good tools to help scale my apps better and understand where I should optimize my code.</p>

<p><strong>Me: </strong>It is true that we area lacking tools but things are changing. On top of the built-in tools like <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/ObjectSpace.html">ObjectSpace</a>, <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/GC/Profiler.html">GC::Profiler</a>, people interested in performance/debugging are working to provide the Ruby community with their expertise, look at <a href="http://memprof.com/">memprof</a> and <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-debug/">ruby-debug</a> for instance. Of course you can also use tools such as <a href="http://ruby-prof.rubyforge.org/">Ruby-prof</a>, <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html">Kcachegrind</a>, <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>. (1.9.2 was <a href="http://github.com/yugui/ruby/tree/feature/dtrace">scheduled to have DTrace support</a> but I did not check yet). Maybe you should be more explicit about what tools you miss and how we could solve the gap.</p>

<h2>ActiveRecord</h2>

<p><strong>Duke:</strong> ActiveRecord doesn't do what I need. How come there is no native support for master/slave DBs, sharding, DB view support is buggy,  suggested indexes on queries is not built-in and errors are not handled properly (server is gone, out of sync etc..)?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> You don't have to use ActiveRecord, you could use any ORM such as <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> or your own. But to answer your question, I think that AR doesn't do everything you want because nobody contributed these features to the project and the people maintaining ActiveRecord don't have the need for these features.</p>

<h2>What can we do?</h2>

<p>We, as a community, need to realize that we have to learn from other communities and other programming languages, this kind of humorous graph is unfortunately not too far from reality.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G7WyP.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Bringing your expertise and knowledge to the Ruby community is important. Looking further than just our own little will push us to improve and fulfill the gaps. Let the community know what tools you are missing, the good practices you think we should be following etc...</p>

<p>Take for instance <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, it's a port of <a href="http://wiki.github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/">Ruby's EventMachine</a> / <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Python's twisted</a>. There is no reasons why the Ruby or Python versions could not do what the Javascript version does. However people are getting excited and are jumping ship. What do we do about that? One way would be to identify what makes node more attractive than EventMachine and what needs to be done so we can offer what people are looking for. I asked this question a few weeks ago and the response was that a lot of the Ruby libraries are blocking and having to check is too bothersome. Maybe that's something that the community should be addressing. Node doesn't have that many libraries and people will have to write them, in the mean time we can make our libs non-blocking. Also, let's not forget that this is not a competition and people should choose the best tool for their projects.</p>

<p>Finally, things don't change overnight, as more people encounter the issues you are facing, as we learn from others, part of the community will focus on the problems you are seeing and things will get better. Hopefully, <strong>you</strong> will also be able to contribute and influence the community to build an even better Ruby world.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/07/29/object-allocation-why-you-should-care/"/>
    <updated>2010-07-29T23:47:50+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/07/29/object-allocation-why-you-should-care</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was tasked with finding how to optimize a web application with heavy traffic. The application (a Rails 2.3.x app) gets about 3 million requests per hour and most of these requests cannot really be easily cached so they go through the entire stack.</p>

<p>This is probably not the case of most web apps out there. None the less, my findings my help you understand Ruby better and maybe think differently about memory management.</p>

<p>This is certainly not an advanced GC blog post, I will try to keep it as simple as possible. My goal is to show you how Ruby memory allocation works and why it can affect your app performance and finally, how can you avoid to allocate to many objects.</p>

<h2>Ruby memory management.</h2>

<p>Rubyists are quite lucky since they don't have to manage the memory themselves. Because developers are lazy and Matz developed his language for people and not machine, memory is managed "magically". Programming should be fun and managing memory isn't really considered fun (ask video game developers or iOS programmers ;)).</p>

<p>So in Ruby, the magical memory management is done by a Garbage Collector. The GC's job is to run and free objects that were previously allocated but not used anymore. Without a GC we would saturate the memory available on the host running the program or would have to deallocate the memory manually. Ruby's GC uses a conservative, stop the world, mark-and-sweep collection mechanism.  More simply, the garbage collection runs when the allocated memory for the process is maxed out. The GC runs and blocks all code from being executed and will free unused objects so new objects can be allocated.</p>

<p>Joe Damato did a great talk on that matter during last RailsConf</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/32718051/Garbage-Collection-and-the-Ruby-Heap">Garbage Collection and the Ruby Heap</a></p>

<p>The problem is that Ruby's GC was not designed to support hundred thousand objects allocation per second. Unfortunately, that's exactly what frameworks like Ruby on Rails do, and you might contribute to the problem too without even knowing it.</p>

<h2>Does it really matter?</h2>

<p>I believe it does. In my case improving the object allocation means much better response time, less servers, less support and less headaches. You might think that servers are cheaper than developers. But more servers mean more developer time spent fixing bugs and more IT support. That's why I think, memory management is something Ruby developers should be aware of and should take in consideration, especially the ones writing frameworks, libraries or shared code.</p>

<p>I am using Ruby 1.9 so I could not profile my Rails 2.x app using <a href="http://memprof.com/">memprof</a>, instead I wrote a <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/GC-stats-middleware">simple and basic middleware</a> that keeps track of the memory allocation/deallocation and GC cycles during a web request (Ruby1.9 only). One of my simple Rails2 actions (1 DB call, simple view) is allocating 170,000 objects per requests. Yes, you read right: 170k objects every single request. At 3 million requests/hour, you can imagine that we are spending a LOT of time waiting for the GC. This is obviously not 100% Rails fault as I am sure our code is contributing to the problem. I heard from the memprof guys that Rails was allocating 40k objects. I decided to check Rails3.</p>

<p>After warming up, a basic Rails3 'hello world' app clocks at about <strong>8,500 objects allocated per request</strong>, forcing the GC to run more or less every 6 requests. On my machine (mac pro) the GC takes about 20ms to free the objects. A Rack 'hello world' app clocks at <strong>7 objects</strong> per request and a Sinatra app at <strong>181 objects</strong>. Of course you can't really compare these different libraries/frameworks but that gives you an idea of the price you pay to get more features.</p>

<p>One thing to remember is that the more objects you allocate, the more time you "lose" at code execution. For more developers, it probably doesn't matter much, but if you should still understand that concept especially if you decide to contribute to the OSS community and offer patches, libraries, plugins etc...</p>

<h1>What can I do?</h1>

<p>Be aware that you are allocating  objects, for instance something as simple as 100.times{ 'foo' } allocates 100 string objects (strings are mutable and therefore each version requires its own memory allocation).</p>

<p>Make sure to evaluate the libraries you use, for instance switching a Sinatra XML rendering action from Builder to Nokogiri XML Builder saved us about 12k object allocations (Thanks Aaron Patterson). Make sure that <strong>if </strong>you are using a library allocating a LOT of objects, that other alternatives are not available and your choice is worth paying the GC cost. (you might not have a lot of requests/s or might not care for a few dozen ms per requests). You can use memprof or one of the many existing tools to check on the GC cycles using load tests or in dev mode. Also, be careful to analyze the data properly and to not only look at the first request. <a href="http://twitter.com/akeem">Someone</a> sent me <a href="http://memprof.com/dump/4c52503c7fdeb62cff000001">this memory dump</a> from a Rails3 'hello world' with Ruby 1.8.7 and it shows that Rails is using <a href="http://memprof.com/dump/4c52503c7fdeb62cff000001/detail?where=%7B%7D">331973 objects</a>.  While this is totally true, it doesn't mean that 330k objects are created per request. Instead that means that 330k objects are currently in memory. Rubygems loading already allocate a lot of objects, Rails even more but these objects won't be GC'd and don't matter as much as the ones allocated every single request. The total amount of memory used by a Ruby process isn't that important, however the fluctuation forcing the GC to run often is. This is why my middleware only cares about the allocation change during a request. (The GC should still traverse the entire memory so, smaller is better)</p>

<p>The more object allocation you do at runtime/per request, the more the GC will need to run, the slower your code will be. So this is not a question of memory space, but more of performance. If your framework/ORM/library/plugin allocates too many objects per request maybe you should start by reporting the problem and if you can, offer some patches.</p>

<p>Here are some hints about memory allocation:</p>

<p>Creating a hash object really allocates more than an object, for instance {'joe' => 'male', 'jane' => 'female'} doesn't allocate 1 object but 7. (one hash, 4 strings + 2 key strings) If you can use symbol keys as they won't be garbage collected. However because they won't be GC'd you want to make sure to not use totally dynamic keys like converting the username to a symbol, otherwise you will 'leak' memory.</p>

<p>Looking at a GC cycle in the Rails3 hello world example shows what objects get deallocated:</p>

<blockquote><p>GC run, previous cycle was 6 requests ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>GC 203 invokes. (amount of cycles since the program was started)
Index   1</p>

<p>Invoke Time(sec)   25.268</p>

<p>Use Size(byte)   4702440</p>

<p>Total Size(byte)   7307264</p>

<p>Total Object   182414</p>

<p>GC Time(ms) 22.35600000000204090611</p>

<h2>56322 freed objects.</h2>

<p><strong>[78%] 44334 freed strings.</strong>
<strong>[7%] 4325 freed arrays.</strong>
[0%] 504 freed bignums.
[1%] 613 freed hashes.
[0%] 289 freed objects.
<strong>[5%] 3030 freed parser nodes (eval usage).</strong></p>

<p>I did not list all the object types but it's pretty obvious that the main issue in the case of Rails is string allocation. To a certain extend the allocated arrays and the runtime use of eval are not helping either. (what is being eval'd at runtime anyway?)</p>

<p>If you use the same string in various place of you code, you can "cache" them using a local var, instance variable, class variable or constant. Sometimes you can just replaced them by a symbol and save a few allocations/deallocations per request. Whatever you do tho, make sure there is a real need for it. My rule of thumb is that if some code gets exercised by 80% of the requests, it should be really optimized and avoid extra allocations so the GC won't slow us down.</p>

<h2>What about a better GC?</h2>

<p>That's the easy answer. When I mentioned this problem with Rails, a lot of people told me that I should use JRuby or Rubinius because their GC were much better. Unfortunately, that's not that simple and choosing an alternative implementation requires much further research and tests.</p>

<p>But what annoys me with this solution is that using it is not solving the issue, it's just working around it. Yes, Ruby's GC isn't that great but that's the not the key issue, <strong>the key issue is that some libraries/frameworks allocate way too many objects</strong> and that nobody seems to care (or to even know it). I know that the Ruby Core Team is working on some optimizations and I am sure Ruby will eventually get an improved GC. In the meantime, it's easy to blame Matz, Koichi and the rest of the core team but again, it's ignoring that the root cause, totally uncontrolled memory allocation.</p>

<p><strong>Maybe it's time for us, Rubyists, to think a bit more about our memory usage.</strong></p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/06/04/au-revoir-rails-community</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time really flies!</p>

<p>Back in December 2005, Ruby on Rails 1.0 was released to the masses. I remember that was when I first got interested in Rails. Six months later, I was doing Rails development full time.</p>

<p>Rails pushed me to contribute to the project, to write plugins, to improve my Ruby knowledge, to release gems and to become a better engineer overall. I then joined the <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb project</a>, focusing on problems I was facing in the various client projects I had back then.</p>

<p>The competition between Rails and Merb turned into a constant confrontation, splitting the Ruby community into two camps. A resolution was later achieved by merging the two teams and focusing our energy on Rails 3. This is how I became a part of the Activism team with <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/">Gregg</a> and <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Ryan</a>. In this new role I was given the opportunity to meet lots of different people from various backgrounds and different communities. I really had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>However, things have changed for me. I won't be at Rails Conf 2010 because in a few weeks I will become a father for the first time. And with that, an obvious priority shift. My day job working on <a href="http://community.modnation.com/">Playstation games</a> is also quite time consuming and the little free time I manage to get to work on my own projects is spent on my <a href="http://macruby.labs.oreilly.com/">MacRuby book</a>. The disconnect between the Rails community and myself is probably more evident now than ever. The challenges encountered by most Railists are so different from the ones I face daily that I think others would do a much better job than I at advocating for Rails. So this is why I believe it's time for me to step away from the Rails community, kick back and relax (and get ready to change a lot of diapers).</p>

<p>This is an "<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/au+revoir">au revoir</a>", not an "<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adieu">Adieu</a>". I will continue to keep an eye on Rails 3 and the fast growing ecosystem.</p>

<p>I will still be writing Ruby for a living and will hopefully keep contributing to the projects I use. And I plan to keep on attending to Ruby conferences around the world just as soon as my kid is old enough to travel with me ;)</p>

<p>Finally, with the imminent release of Rails 3, I hope to see even more people stand up and advocate for Ruby on Rails the way Gregg Pollack, Ryan Bates and many others have done so far.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/05/09/writing-an-open-licensed-book/"/>
    <updated>2010-05-09T22:40:06+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/05/09/writing-an-open-licensed-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate last week's release of <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2010/04/30/macruby06.html">MacRuby 0.6</a>, O'Reilly and I started publishing the draft of my MacRuby book online: <a href="http://macruby.labs.oreilly.com/">http://macruby.labs.oreilly.com/</a></p>

<p>I started thinking about working on "<a href="http://macruby.labs.oreilly.com/">MacRuby: The Definitive Guide</a>" last year when I realized that the project had a great future but there was a serious lack of documentation. With the support of the MacRuby team, I worked on a table of contents and a pitch. The next step was to decide what we wanted to do with the book.</p>

<p>I know a lot of technical book authors and most of them will tell you the same thing: if you think that you are going to make money writing a book, you are wrong. Even if your book sells well, because of the time invested in writing the book, you are probably better off doing consulting work and charging by the hour.</p>

<p>So since day one, I knew that this project would not make me rich. The goal was to share knowledge not to reimburse my mortgage or save California from bankruptcy. While publishing a web book is great, distribution is quite limited, especially if you try to reach people outside of your network. That's why I decided to start talking to a few publishers. Most publishers I talked to were interested in working on the book, however they were not really keen on publishing a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative</a> licensed book.</p>

<p>Let me explain why I think releasing technical books under a CC license is important. As you might know (or have figured out by now), I am not a native English speaker. I actually learned my first English words thanks to the computer my dad had at home. The problem when you don't live in an English speaking country and you want to learn about the cutting edge technology is that you have to understand English.  Thanks to the Internet, learning and practicing English is now much easier that it used to be. However, if you want to have access to books, most of the time you have to wait until someone translates the book and publishes it in your country or you have to manage to get an English version delivered to your country. This is often a pain because of national credit card limitations, international delivery restrictions etc... If you manage to find a way to get a copy, the book ends up costing a lot of money.</p>

<p>What does that mean in practice? Most of the technical books are first available in the English speaking western world, then slowly translated and/or distributed around the world. By the time you get a legal copy in Bolivia, Algeria or Vietnam, a new edition is probably out in the US probably because the technology evolved. Maybe that explains some of the book piracy worldwide?</p>

<p>Think about it for a minute: knowledge is power and time is money. And what do we do? We delay knowledge distribution. This is why I am a big fan of the <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> and its awesome free online courses.</p>

<p>Turns out <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> shares my vision and has already published a lot of books under various open licenses: <a href="http://oreilly.com/openbook/">http://oreilly.com/openbook/</a> I was also interested in publishing the content of my book ASAP so people could access it right away even though there would be lots of typos and missing content. This is also something O'Reilly has already done with the <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/">CouchDB</a> and the <a href="http://labs.oreilly.com/ofps.html">Scala</a> books.</p>

<p>Talking with <a href="http://twitter.com/janl">Jan Lehnardt</a> about his experience working with O'Reilly on the <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/">'CouchDB: The definitive guide'</a> book, I realized that we seem to have some shared interests. I contacted Jan's editor and we decided to start working on the MacRuby book. The book will be available later on in all the usual commercial formats and I hope people will show their support so O'Reilly will be encouraged in their choice to continue publishing CC licensed book. At the end of the day, purchasing a CC licensed book helps supporting the authors, the publishers but also all the people who can't have access to the latest technical books.</p>

<p>Finally, working on a book is not an easy thing, especially when you have to write it in a language that's not yours. But I have to say that the community support has been amazing. Even <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/03/macruby-aimonetti">John Gruber sent a fireball my way</a>. And since the announcement was made, I have received a lot of <a href="http://macruby.labs.oreilly.com/comments/feed?id=book">comments</a>, tweets, emails etc... It is very encouraging and it gives me the motivation needed to work on the book after a long work day.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/03/15/i-did-it-wrong/"/>
    <updated>2010-03-15T23:50:49+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/03/15/i-did-it-wrong</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Ruby community is a well known for at least two things: <strong>being </strong><a href="http://pragprog.com/press_releases/the-passionate-programmer">passionate</a><strong> and being </strong><a href="http://www.bruisin-ales.com/beerblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/stoneintro.gif">arrogant</a> .
Two characteristics that often go together but I am not going to defend or justify anything in this post, instead I will try to reflect on my own experience and will share with you my own view point.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_wrong_coaster_2.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_wrong_coaster_2-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Very much like the Ruby community, I am also quite passionate and can be arrogant at times. A few months back I was in Brazil for <a href="http://www.railssummit.com.br/en/pages/home">RailsSummit</a> and I was chatting with <a href="http://twitter.com/dchelimsky">David Chelimsky</a> after a nice evening with the <a href="http://www.railssummit.com.br/en/pages/home">RailsSummit</a> attendees. I was thinking about how cool it was to have people from various non-Ruby communities to come to a Ruby community and share their experience and knowledge while observing the ways we do things with Ruby.</p>

<p>David and I got to talk about technical evangelism, how <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> became very popular, the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merb">Merb</a> vs <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> situation which turned into Rails3, as well as <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>. I was interested by the fact that I couldn't remember David ever saying something bad about test/unit or trying to tell others they were doing it wrong. Instead, he has always tried showing why people might be potentially interested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec">RSpec</a>.</p>

<p>As an early RSpec adopter, I often thought that people were wrong not to use the solution that <em><strong>I</strong></em> thought was the best. As part of the Merb 'propaganda', we spent a lot of time comparing Merb with Rails and showing why Merb might be better for you and why you were doing it wrong if you would fit in Merb's target and still use Rails.</p>

<p>Even before that, I remember thinking that if you were not using Ruby, you were doing it wrong. PHP &amp; Java developers were, for me, just developers who did not know any better (and I thought that Python-ers were just too lazy to learn a "better" language that takes OOP seriously ;)).</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_it_wrong_coaster.jpg"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/doing_it_wrong_coaster-300x218.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Since then, things have changed. I have gotten involved with other projects, met different people and maybe, just maybe, matured a little bit. Going back to the discussion I had with David, he pointed out to me how often people talk about a piece of technology or an idea to just quickly conclude: <strong>"it sucks"</strong> and it has got even worse lately with the '<a href="http://www.doingitwrong.com/">you're doing it wrong</a> ' meme.</p>

<p>Basically, we judge people's actions without knowing them or even having a clue about the problem they are facing and we just tell them that if they don't do like us, they are wrong. If they are not using this plugin or this gem, they are doing it wrong, and if they are using this other one that sucks, they are also doing it wrong. Also, be careful, something that's hot today will probably turn out to be 'the suck' soon enough, keep up with what the cool kids tweet about ;)</p>

<p>But of course, this is something human and much bigger than the Ruby community. Look at the whole SQL/NoSQL <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1163039">pseudo fight</a> and you will notice the same attitude. Look at the editors war, look at the OS war or even look at the TV with shows like '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Marriage%20Ref">Marriage Ref</a>' making money off of people wanting to prove their partner that he/she is doing it wrong. But that's also the root problem of most religion wars and even the motivation for some people to go 'invade/colonize' other countries to eventually force their world vision upon them.</p>

<p>I realize the irony of writing of blog post to tell my readers that telling others that they are doing it wrong is, in itself, fundamental wrong, but maybe next time you think something sucks or is totally wrong, you might want to try to understand the motivation behind why some people decided to go this way. I know I will personally try harder.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/02/22/speed-up-your-rails-xml-responses/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-22T23:25:09+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/02/22/speed-up-your-rails-xml-responses</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/">work</a>, we have an XML API that gets quite a lot of traffic. Last week I looked into improving its performance since we are expecting more traffic soon and want to make sure our response time is optimized.</p>

<p>My first thought was to make sure we had  an optimized <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/XmlMini.html">ActiveSupport's xmlmini backend</a>. Rails 2.3.5 fixed some issues when using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> as a xmlmini so I switched to my favorite Ruby XML lib:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend = 'Nokogiri'
</code></pre>

<p>I run some benchmarks using ab, httperf and jmeter but the results were not that great. I was so sure that switching from <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/index.html">rexml</a> to <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">nokogiri</a> would give me awesome results that I was very disappointed.</p>

<p>I was about to call <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/">Aaron Patterson</a> (Nokogiri's author) to insult him, blame him for _why's disappearance and tell him that all his pro bono efforts were useless since my own app was not running much faster when switched to his library. As I was about to dial his number on my iPhone I had a crazy thought... maybe it was not Aaron's fault, maybe it was mine.</p>

<p>So I took a break went to play some fuzzball and as I was being ridiculed by Italian coworker, Emanuele, I realized that most of our API calls were just simple HTTP requests with no XML payload, just some query params. However, we were generating a lot of XML to send back to the client and AS::XmlMini only takes care of the XML parsing, not the rendering.</p>

<p>The XML rendering is done by <a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a>'s pure Ruby <a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org/">builder library</a> which is vendored in Rails. Builder does a good job, but I thought that maybe a C based library might improve the speed. A coworker of mine (James Bunch) recommended to look into <a href="http://github.com/codahale/faster-builder">faster-builder</a>, a drop-in Builder replacement based on libxml. Unfortunately, the project doesn't seem to be maintained and I decided to look into using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> XML builder instead. (Also, faster-builder's author doesn't like me very much while Aaron knows he's one of my Ruby heroes so asking for help could be easier)</p>

<p>Some people reported having tried using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> as a XML builder but didn't see much speed improvement. Because of the amount of magic required to render a rxml template, I was not really surprised but I decided to contact Aaron and ask him if he tried using his lib instead of builder in a Rails app. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronp/57241193/">Aaron</a> told me he gave it a try a while back and he helped me get my Rails app setup to render xml templates using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a>.</p>

<p>The next step was simple, create a <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/noko-vs-builder-benchmark">benchmark app</a> and benchmark Builder vs Nokogiri using various templates. Here are the results I got using Ruby 1.9.1 (the Ruby version we use in production) and two sets of templates:</p>

<p><strong>Builder</strong> small template, <strong>time per request: 15.507 [ms]</strong> (mean)</p>

<p>Running the benchmarks many times showed that Nokogiri and Builder were taking more or less the same amount of time to builder a small template.</p>

<p>I then decided to try a bigger template, closer to what we have in production, here are the results:</p>

<p><strong>Nokogiri</strong> longer template, <strong>time per request: 31.252 [ms] (mean)</strong></p>

<p>Wow, <a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a>'s Nokogori just brought us a<strong> 4.5X speed improvement for this specific template</strong>.  100ms per request is probably not a big deal for most people and I have to say that Jim did a great job with Builder. However in my specific case, 100ms on a request being called thousands of times per hour is quite important.</p>

<p>(The <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/noko-vs-builder-benchmark">benchmark app is available on github</a>, feel free to fork it and benchmark your own templates)</p>

<p>Who would have thought that a man like this could save the day?!</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/02/03/googlecharts-1-5-1/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-03T21:18:23+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/02/03/googlecharts-1-5-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the relaunch of this site and since we are waiting for Rails 3.0 beta to be released, I figured I should share with you what I worked on the other night.</p>

<p>I merged patches, refactored and released a new version of googlecharts, my Gem to create graphs using Google Chart API.</p>

<p><code>sudo gem install googlecharts</code></p>

<p>Here is a quick example of how the API works when dealing with a complex graph:</p>

<pre><code>require 'gchart' # or require 'googlecharts' if you prefer to use the Googlecharts constant.
title = "Player Count"
size = "575x300"
data = [85,107,123,131,155,172,173,189,203,222,217,233,250,239,256,267,247,261,275,295,288,305,322,307,325,347,331,346,363,382,343,359,383,352,374,393,358,379,396,416,377,398,419,380,409,426,453,432,452,465,436,460,480,440,457,474,501,457,489,507,347,373,413,402,424,448,475,488,513,475,507,530,440,476,500,518,481,512,531,367,396,423,387,415,446,478,442,469,492,463,489,508,463,491,518,549,503,526,547,493,530,549,493,520,541,564,510,535,564,492,512,537,502,530,548,491,514,538,568,524,548,568,512,533,552,577,520,545,570,516,536,555,514,536,566,521,553,579,604,541,569,595,551,581,602,549,576,606,631,589,615,650,597,624,646,672,605,626,654,584,608,631,574,597,622,559,591,614,644,580,603,629,584,615,631,558,591,618,641,314,356,395,397,429,450,421,454,477,507,458,490,560,593]
Gchart.line(:title =&gt; title, :size =&gt; size, :data =&gt; data, :axis_with_labels =&gt; 'x,y', :line_color =&gt; '1e60cc', :axis_labels =&gt; [(1.upto(24).to_a &lt;&lt; 1)], :max_value =&gt; 700, :custom =&gt; 'chg=10,15,1,0')
</code></pre>

<p>Which provides you with the url or image tag (or downloaded file) that produces the following graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxl=0:|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|1&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chco=1e60cc&amp;chg=10,15,1,0&amp;chd=s:HJKLNPPQRTTUWVWXVXYaZbcbcedeghefhfhifhjkhjlhklomopmoqmopsorsehkjlnqrtqsumqstqtvgjliknqnprprsprtwsuwruwruvxtvxrtvsuwrtvyuwytvwzuwytvxtvyuwz1vy0wz1wz130250357135z13y03x025z13z23x024bfijlnloqsorx0&amp;chtt=Player+Count&amp;cht=lc&amp;chs=575x300&amp;chxr=1,85,700" alt="Google Chart" /></p>

<p>This release works great with Ruby 1.9 and <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a>, lots of bugs got fixed and some new features were added. Something a lot of people complained was that the gem was called googlecharts but that the main class was called Gchart. The problem was that I wrote my gem and called it Gchart and when I went to register the rubyforge project page, the name was already taken. In this release, I fixed this problem by allowing users to require and use the constant name they want, Gchart or Googlecharts. I also spent quite a lot of time cleaning up the old code which I was a bit ashamed of. Class variables are now removed and overall, the code should be a bit more sane.</p>

<p>The source code can be found in my <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/googlecharts/">GitHub accout</a> and the documentation <a href="http://mattetti.github.com/googlecharts/">there</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is now official: I have traded my freedom &amp; home office for a job title, an Aeron chair in a cubicle and a 401K.</p>

<p>I received my new employee package and, in less than a week, I will officially become a full-time employee at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_of_America"> SCEA</a> (Sony Computer Entertainment America).</p>

<p>I'm going to work in the PlayStation department, working on PS3, PS2 and PSP game titles developed by <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com/">various</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCE_Studio_San_Diego">game</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_Worldwide_Studios">studios</a>.</p>

<h3>Why 'o why?</h3>

<p><em>Why leave behind a happy life of indie contracting to join corporate America?</em></p>

<p>For many reasons actually:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Team</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Being a consultant I have been working with other independent consultants and existing teams. Nonetheless, I really miss being part of a stable team which grows together and learns from each other as we go through new projects and maintain old ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long term plan</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>As a consultant, I usually start projects or "rescue" existing projects. I work on them for a little while and then move on. It's exciting and rewarding but you don't really pay the consequences of your mistakes. You usually don't have to maintain the code you wrote and you rarely deal with the mistakes <em>you</em> made.</p>

<p>It sounds good, nobody likes to maintain the crappy awesome code they wrote 2 years ago and most developers love working on new stuff. But at the same time, to become a better engineer you need to learn from you mistakes and assuming responsibility for your bad decisions is part of the process.</p>

<p>It might sound weird, but I'm actually excited to work on long term projects and feel some sort of ownership over the projects. Having to support games for many years means that I'd better not mess up the implementation. And if I do, I hope I'll quickly learn from my mistakes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoiding burn out</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>There is no secret: when you are passionate about what you do, you have a hard time stopping and taking a break. I'm a recovering workaholic and it's really hard for me to say no when I'm presented the possibility to work on interesting projects. I love what I do and I keep writing code even after I'm done with client work.</p>

<p>The problem is that this can start me on the slippery slope to isolating myself from friends, family and people who don't share the same passion. I'm really lucky that my wife is a geek and loves hanging out at conferences, looking at code and playing with my buggy prototypes. But still, I spend too much time "playing" with my computer and I just can't manage my free time wisely.</p>

<p>Having a full time position will hopefully help me put boundaries and will hopefully teach me to disconnect from work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exciting projects</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Hey, let's be honest, how many geeks do you know don't want to work in the video game industry? By the way, if you don't have a PS3, they are now at $299 and on top of getting an awesome console you get a blue ray player! (And no, I do not receive any bonuses or commissions for mentioning the console or promoting it in my blog. I had to pay for my own like everyone else.)</p>

<h3>Corporate America? Are you going to write Java now?</h3>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/1264424156_24f4571b10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>No, I'm mainly going to stick to the language I love: <strong>Ruby</strong>.
From time to time I will probably use other languages here and there, but that usually makes me love Ruby even more. The reality is that Ruby's power and flexibility seem to be appreciated by SCEA, which makes sense when you have tight deadlines and a lot of new technologies to deal with. Ruby is a perfect match!</p>

<p>As you can guess, I can't go into any detail about how and why Sony uses Ruby, but let me just say that while games are still usually written in C++, they are becoming more and more interactive and need to communicate with game servers where some logic operates. Game players also need to interact with other gamers as well as check their gaming progress online, as well as the progress of the players around them etc... Basically, outside of the game engine and the console SDK, there is a lot of potential for Ruby.</p>

<p>Coming back to Corporate America, I have to say that I've known my future manager for a few years now. He's always been a fervent Ruby advocate and has introduced lots of teams to the happiness of Ruby &amp; Rails development. He's also a great developer who's contributing patches to major projects and has a bunch of cool stuff on github. To give you an idea, my job description mentions Rails, Merb, Sinatra, CouchdB, MongoDB, Redis, AWS. All these Ruby technologies are actually already used in production or are being seriously evaluated.</p>

<p>I'm also really looking forward to join the existing team. I know I'm going to love working with a bunch of awesome developers coming from various backgrounds.</p>

<p>Those who know me, know that I'm not a morning person. And while your typical office job is categorized as '9-5', don't feel too bad for me. I will be joining the video game product department, and morning people are rather rare in these kinds of groups ;)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'm really excited about this opportunity. For me, it is proof again that the Ruby revolution took place and that the Enterprise is evolving. Of course, time will tell if I am right, but I am quite confident.</p>

<p>Also, Sony is always looking for new, talented people who want to push the entertainment world to the next level. Feel free to keep in touch with me if you are interested in joining the fun.</p>

    <updated>2010-01-31T19:13:36+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/01/31/macruby-0-5-final-is-out</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After going through two betas, MacRuby 0.5 final is now released and can be downloaded by clicking on the icon below:</p>

<p><a href="http://macruby.org/downloads.html"><img src="http://macruby.org/images/zip.png" alt="" />
MacRuby 0.5</a></p>

<p>Don't worry about having MacRuby and Ruby 1.8.x or 1.9 installed, MacRuby is namespaced and won't affect your current Ruby installations, just download and launch the installer. (Note: The build was compiled for SnowLeopard only)</p>

<p>You can read all the <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2010/01/31/macruby05.html">details of the release on the MacRuby website</a>.</p>

<p>So what changed since 0.4? Too many things for me to list them here but basically 0.5 uses LLVM to compile code and make MacRuby faster and integrate better with the Obj-c runtime. However since the last beta, here is what changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HotCocoa is now a separate gem</p></li>
<li><p>improved AOT compilation</p></li>
<li><p>Grand Central Dispatch support - use all your cores without the pain of threads. Read <a href="http://www.macruby.org/documentation/gcd.html">this post</a> for more info.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>0.5 is a solid release which I consider production ready, I personally wrote a few of small Cocoa apps in MacRuby and everything has been working very well. Of course, I'm also excited about the new stuff in 0.6 trunk like the debugger previewed a few weeks ago: <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/">http://merbist.com/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby/</a> but also some drastic changes in the primitive classes that I might cover later on.</p>

<p>Finally, people are asking if the iPad will be able to run apps running in MacRuby. Unfortunately, the current answer is: no. The two issues with the IPhone/iP*d OS are the lack of Garbage Collector and support for BridgeSupport (needed to define CocoaTouch constants available from MacRuby). However, this matter is being discussed on the mailing list and progress is made by contributors (the core team primarily focusing on the desktop).</p>

<p>That is going to be an exciting Ruby week as MacRuby 0.5 is now out and Rails 3 beta/RC0 is expected really soon.</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/01/18/how-to-detect-cylons-with-macruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, MacRuby's trunk became version 0.6 and the bug fixing is currently done in both the 0.5 branch and trunk. Based on MacRuby's usual release cycle I would expect a 0.5 beta3 or 0.5 final to be released soon so most of the work can be focused on trunk.</p>

<p>I'll let you check on the <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/repository/ruby/MacRuby/trunk/TODO">TODO list</a> to see what was done in 0.5 and what is in the plan for 0.6.</p>

<p>However, there is one feature in 0.6 that I know lots of you will just love! The good news is that Laurent already committed a very early version of his work so I figured, I should share the good news with you:</p>

<h3>Introducing MacRuby's debugger!</h3>

<p>If you were expecting to read: "a Cylon detector!", keep on reading.</p>

<p>Again, this feature is in really early development since it's scheduled for 0.6 and 0.5 final is not out yet. But if you install MacRuby using the <a href="http://macruby.icoretech.org/">nightly builds</a> or build from trunk, you can already play with the debugger.</p>

<p>Let me give you a really quick tour of the debugger.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100118-qn7yuq9h2ce61yxt6kwag9pnbt.jpg" alt="BSG75Logo posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>Let's imagine that we were given the task to debug the cylon detector written by Gaius Baltar which looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>characters = %w{Adama Apollo Baltar Roslin StarBuck Six}

def cylon?(character)
  false
end

characters.each do |character|
  if cylon?(character)
    puts "#{character} is a Cylon!"
  else
    puts "#{character} is not a cylon."
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what happens when I execute the script:</p>

<pre><code>$ macruby cylon_detector.rb 
Adama is not a cylon.
Apollo is not a cylon.
Baltar is not a cylon.
Roslin is not a cylon.
StarBuck is not a cylon.
Six is not a cylon.
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem is that we all know that Six is a Cylon, the detector isn't working right so let's debug it:</p>

<pre><code>$ macrubyd cylon_detector.rb
Starting program.
cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; b cylon_detector.rb:8 if character == 'Six'
Added breakpoint 1.
cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; c
Adama is not a cylon.
Apollo is not a cylon.
Baltar is not a cylon.
Roslin is not a cylon.
StarBuck is not a cylon.
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; false
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p "This detector is broken!"
=&gt; "This detector is broken!"
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p def cylon?(character); character == 'Six'; end
=&gt; nil
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; true
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?('Matt')
=&gt; false
cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; c
Six is a Cylon!
Program exited.
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we do is to add a conditional breakpoint:</p>

<pre><code>b cylon_detector.rb:8 if character == 'Six'
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the debugger will add a breakpoint at line 8 which will only be active when the value of 'character' is equal to 'Six'.
Now that the breakpoint added, we can continue the program execution and just wait until we reach the defined condition.</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:1&gt; c
</code></pre>

<p>Once we reach the breakpoint, we evaluate the result of "cylon?(character)" by using the p command. We see that the result is "false" when we know for sure that it should be true since the value of the character variable is 'Six' and she is a cylon. At this point, you might have guessed that somewhat acted as a cylon agent and I pretended to fix the problem by overwriting the "cylon?" method:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p def cylon?(character); character == 'Six'; end
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the method is overwritten, I can check that Six is recognized as being a cylon:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?(character)
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>and also check that I am not detected a cylon:</p>

<pre><code>cylon_detector.rb:8&gt; p cylon?('Matt')
=&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>I can now continue the execution of the program and see that Six is detected as a Cylon!</p>

<p>Of course this is just a very early version of the debugger and we will see lots of improvement in the next few weeks. Who knows someone might even create a GUI for the debugger and/or a Xcode integration.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point being that MacRuby developers should expect a lot of awesome stuff coming up their way soon. (also be careful about the skin jobs around you, cylon detectors can't be trusted!)</p>

    <updated>2010-01-17T19:54:19+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/01/17/controlling-itunes-with-macruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since Mac OS X v10.5, Apple added a technology called Scripting Bridge which allows to control and communicate with scriptable applications such as Mail, iChat or iTunes.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/12/31/im-new-year-count-down-with-macruby/">I showed how to control iChat</a> with MacRuby. This time I'm going to show you how to control iTunes.</p>

<p>Here is a small script that I wrote to wake me up in music every morning.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/macruby
framework 'Foundation'
framework 'ScriptingBridge'

itunes = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier("com.apple.itunes")
load_bridge_support_file 'iTunes.bridgesupport'
itunes.run

class SBElementArray
  def [](value)
    self.objectWithName(value)
  end
end

itunes.stop
playlist = itunes.sources["Library"].userPlaylists["morning"]
playlist.playOnce(false) if playlist
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that I have a Mac Mini streaming music through speakers connected to an AirportExpress in my bedroom.</p>

<p>Let's go through the script quickly.</p>

<p>We start by loading two frameworks, Foundation and ScriptingBridge.
Now that we have ScriptingBridge loaded, we can control iTunes. To do that, we use:
SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier("com.apple.itunes")
We then load a bridgesupport file that contains the enumerated constants from the iTunes scriptable dictionary.</p>

<p>We make sure iTunes is running by calling #run on the application object.</p>

<p>Before using iTune scriptable interface, we are making the API a bit nicer, it's totally unnecessary but it makes our code look better.</p>

<p>itunes.sources returns an instance of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Reference/SBElementArray_Class/SBElementArray/SBElementArray.html">SBElementArray</a> which is not really an array nor a hash.</p>

<p>The rest of the code is pretty simple, we find the library, find the playlist called 'morning' and play it if found.</p>

<p>So you might wonder two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the iTunes.bridgesupport file?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know what methods are available to control iTunes?</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>bridgesupport file</h4>

<p>The bridgesupport file is important since it defines the required constants.
Apple provides a metadata generator called gen_bridge_metadata which generates a bridgesupport file.</p>

<p>Here is what the documentation says:</p>

<pre><code>$ man gen_bridge_metadata




NAME
gen_bridge_metadata -- Objective-C Bridges Metadata Generator

SYNOPSIS
gen_bridge_metadata [options...] headers...

DESCRIPTION
gen_bridge_metadata is a tool that generates bridging metadata information for a given framework or set of head-
ers. The Objective-C bridges supported in Mac OS X, such as RubyCocoa (Ruby) and PyObjC (Python), read this
information at runtime.

Metadata files describe the parts of an Objective-C framework that the bridges cannot automatically handle. These
are primarily the ANSI C elements of the framework -- functions, constants, enumerations, and so on -- but also
include special cases such as functions or methods that accept pointer-like arguments. These special cases must
be manually specified in separate files called exceptions. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can then read in the
exceptions file when it generates the framework metadata.

The file extension used for metadata files should be .bridgesupport.

Certain elements, such as inline functions, cannot be described in the metadata files. It is therefore required
to generate a dynamic library in order to make the bridges use them. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can take care
of that for you.

The file extension for the dynamic libraries should be .dylib.

You should install metadata files in one of three filesystem locations. For example, for a framework named
MyFramework that is installed as /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework.framework, you can install the
MyFramework.bridgesupport and MyFramework.dylib files in one of the following possible locations, in order of
priority:

o   /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework/Resources/BridgeSupport

o   /Library/BridgeSupport

o   ~/Library/BridgeSupport
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that we don't have a framework or header file to generate a bridgesupport file for.
So, what we need a header file for iTunes, turns out we have a tool to do that:</p>

<pre><code>$ sdef /Applications/iTunes.app | sdp -fh --basename iTunes
</code></pre>

<p>I won't go in the details of what sdef and sdp do, just check their manual page.
Running the command above will create a iTunes.h which we can use to create a bridgesupport file.
Here is the generated header file: http://gist.github.com/279657</p>

<p>Now, let's create a bidgesupport file:</p>

<pre><code>$ gen_bridge_metadata -c '-I.' iTunes.h &gt; iTunes.bridgesupport
</code></pre>

<p>An that's how we get the bridgesupport file. (see file: <a href="http://gist.github.com/279698">http://gist.github.com/279698</a>)</p>

<h4>iTunes Documentation</h4>

<p>The easiest way to understand what's available to you is to open iTunes' dictionary in the AppleScript Editor.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100118-fe5c3224jd8xfhciwqxpy4hptc.jpg" alt="iTunes API by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>Otherwise you can study the iTunes.h file.</p>

<p>I wrote a very dumb parser to give you an idea of the methods and properties available when controlling iTunes via ScriptingBridge, here is the  output:</p>

    <updated>2010-01-05T17:36:12+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2010/01/05/amazon-kindle-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For Noël, my wife got me a new toy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=merbist-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015T963C">the Amazon Kindle 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?tag=merbist-20"><img src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/360x280_AmazonProduct/" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2>Kindle vs Nook</h2>

<p>Before my wife bought what became my new favorite gadget, we checked on the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4176062087_704a33b9fd_m.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The primary problem with the Nook was that it was out of stock. That pushed me to dig deeper and really compare both devices.</p>

<p>The Nook had some interesting features like wifi, small color screen and the book lending feature.</p>

<p>However, I don't really care about a small, clunky extra color screen since I just want to read books. The wifi is nice... but what am I going to do with it? Lending books is a cool feature, but this feature isn't available for all books and is apparently seriously limited.</p>

<p>So I decided to focus on what I really needed instead of what I could use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The main purpose of an e-book is reading, page loading should be fast and the user experience should be at least as good as when reading a 'real' book.</p></li>
<li><p>I need to be able to have a great choice of books and if possible in multiple languages.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to be able to read the <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">safarionline</a> books that I can access online.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>From what I read almost everywhere, the nook is slow and a bit buggy (it's a first generation after all) and doesn't come with a web browser. I also checked on the ebooks available on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. Amazon has way more ebooks and that's really what motivated my decision. The other thing is that Amazon is present world wide and I expect them to start selling more ebooks in French and Spanish.</p>

<p>The other thing that pushed me to buy a Kindle was the fact that I know so many people having one and being so pleased. During a recent trip to San Diego, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/yehudakatz">Yehuda Katz</a> told me about how much he loves his Kindle and he recommended a book to read. I started reading the book on my iPhone (using kindle for iPhone) and was really wanted a bigger screen.</p>

<h2>Kindle vs iTablet</h2>

<p>A lot of people asked me why I didn't wait for the big announcement of the iTablet because it might be a Kindle killer.</p>

<p>First, the iTablet is currently just a rumor and if we would believe the rumor, the iTablet will sell around $1,000 vs $250 for a kindle. The tablet will probably do a lot of cool stuff my e-reader can't do... but I don't care I chose the kindle because I wanted a simple device to read book and only do that. Actually, the  kindle + iphone combo works great for me. I used to read a lot but because I have been moving so many times I started reading less because I always get rid of my books. Also, when traveling a lot, carrying your books with you is a pain. (especially now that most airlines charge you per bag)</p>

<h2>Kindle and tech books/documentation.</h2>

<p>If you want a kindle to read tech books, don't get a 6", get the kindle DX instead. Even though the 6" natively supports PDF files, the text is usually too small and the Kindle doesn't support zooming (yet).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015TCML0?tag=merbist-20"><img src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/360x280_AmazonProduct/" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The DX is perfect to read PDFs because the ratio matches the print expectations. I was thinking about converting all the Cocoa docs to a kindle friendly format since the kindle supports search etc.. But the truth is that it's not worth it. The display on a 6" screen is clunky, it just doesn't feel right. I didn't try any of the pragprog ebooks but something tells me they will just look better on the DX.</p>

<p>Since I wanted a kindle to read books and not browse tech documentation, I'm still really happy with 6".</p>

<p>If you also have kindle or are planning on buying one soon, here are two books I've been enjoying reading:</p>

    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/12/29/fun-with-macruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be ready for 2010, I'm taking some time off relaxing and spending time with my family in Florida.</p>

<p>During my free time, I've been reading, catching up on movies and TV shows and worked on the MacRuby book that I am writing for O'Reilly.</p>

<p>I wrote a bunch of small apps, played with various APIs and every single time I was amazed by all the goodies Apple makes available to developers. My most recent discovery is very simple but I wanted to share it with you.</p>

<p>I often type text in English, French and Spanish and I even mix the languages from time to time. SnowLeopard comes with a great spellchecker that auto detects the language I'm typing in and is most of the time correct. It's a very impressive feature and I was wondering if, as a MacRuby developer, I could use one of Apple's lib to detect what language is being used.  I dug through the documentation but didn't find anything. I started looking at some header files and found the API to use :)</p>

<pre><code>framework 'Foundation'
class String
  def language
    CFStringTokenizerCopyBestStringLanguage(self, CFRangeMake(0, self.size))
  end

    <updated>2009-11-30T13:38:53+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/11/30/lots-of-rubies-now-what</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you were at RubyConf 2009 or looked at the schedule, you saw that the big thing happening in the Ruby scene is the maturation of a many of the Ruby implementations:
BlueRuby, HotRuby, IronRuby, JRuby, MacRuby, Maglev, MRI, REE, Rubinius, SmallRuby...
Ruby developers really have plenty of choice when it comes to choosing an alternative Ruby implementation.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing?</p>

<p>Turns out, Matz , Ruby author mentioned one ore time during RubyConf that it was actually a good thing for the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>But maybe we should take a step back and look at the big picture. So here are some of my thoughts on the topic. <em>(disclaimer: being part of the MacRuby team, I'm certainly biased)</em></p>

<p><strong>Stop comparing alternative Ruby implementations against Ruby 1.8.x.</strong></p>

<p>Even though a lot of people are still using Ruby 1.8.x, it's totally unfair to compare against such an old version of Matz's Ruby.
Ruby 1.9 is what people should compare against and believe me, Ruby 1.9.2 is going to change the game (much faster, cleaned up version).
Hopefully, all the Ruby alternative implementations will quickly become 1.9 compatible.</p>

<p>(On a site note, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/11/30/ruby-on-rails-2-3-5-released">Rails 2.3.5 was released</a> a few days ago which fixes some of the last few remaining Ruby 1.9 bugs)</p>

<p><strong>Don't trust the benchmarks</strong></p>

<p>As we all know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics">there are lies, damn lies and statistics</a>. Evan Phoenix explained that very clearly with lots of examples during his <a href="http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/">RubyConf talk</a> and I totally agree with him.
Micro benchmarks only help implementers know where they are standing and find performance issue.
Let's take a very simple example: <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>.
What you might not know is that most JRuby benchmarks are usually 'warmed up'.  Basically, to get the results you see in most reported benchmarks, you need to run the benchmark in a loop X amount of times and then run the benchmark. The reason for that is that JRuby uses HotSpot which needs to process the code to optimize the JITting and finally get your code to run faster.
The problem is that it is not a fair comparison. I was benchmarking Rails3 for instance and JRuby starts way slower than Ruby 1.8.6 and takes a little while to get as fast/faster than 1.9.1.
This is something you need to take in consideration since each deployment will slow down your app and you probably shouldn't use JRuby if you are not using long running processes.
Another example would be MacRuby, even though the MacRuby project never released any benchmarks, it's known to be a <em>fast</em> implementation.
Currently, the allocation of objects in MacRuby is actually still a bit costly and if you benchmark that, you can <em>show</em> that MacRuby is slow. Other operations are super optimized and both Rubinius and MacRuby will be way faster than anyone else. (check Phoenix's talk at Ruby conf for more examples)
So, before choosing an implementation for performance reasons, benchmark against the code you are going to use.</p>

<p><strong>There is only one real original Ruby</strong></p>

<p>I think nobody will disagree with the fact that there is only one Ruby reference and that's Matz.
Therefore is only one "real" Ruby and that is Matz's. (Matz actually disagreed with me when I said that, since all the other implementations are also "real" but you get the point)
There is nothing wrong with Ruby's alternatives but they stay alternatives to the original
MRI might not be the best option for every single case out there but it is and will stay the reference.</p>

<p>During RubyConf, I was joking with Matz and Koichi that maybe they should claim a Ruby tax to the Ruby implementations.
The reality is that Ruby is maintained by 5 to 10 contributors, most of them doing that on the side of their full time job.
Most of the other implementations have full time staff working hard on their implementations. That's exciting but sad at the same time.</p>

<p>During the different talks given by the Ruby core team, it was clear that they really want to bridge the West/East gap and asked for help. It's very honorable on their part and I hope we will see more contributions coming from outside Japan.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that even if people work hard to write the best Ruby implementation ever, let's not forget to respect Matz's project, team and achievements. People spent hours/weeks/months creating the Ruby language we love and even though there are some aspects that could be and are being improved, let's not forget that when criticizing/comparing their work.</p>

<p><strong>There is not only one way to do things</strong></p>

<p>I don't know where that's coming from, but some people in our community seem to believe that there is only one way to do things and if you don't do it their way, you do it wrong.
I personally have a hard time believing that and I even think it goes against what Ruby was designed for. (However, I must admit that sometimes I did/do think that some approaches were totally wrong :p)
It reminds me of people trying to convince you that God exists, other people trying to convince you that their religion is the only true one, or finally the other people trying to convince believers that they are wrong.
Maybe it is just that as humans we have a hard time dealing with people coming to a different conclusion than us and therefore we have to convince them that we are right and they are wrong.</p>

<p>The way I see it, for any new Ruby project, you should start be using with Ruby1.9. If it doesn't fit your needs, then, consider an alternative. Here is how I look at the other alternatives (feel free to disagree):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/display/Research/BlueRuby">BlueRuby</a> - use if you are writing a SAP app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://hotruby.yukoba.jp/">HotRuby</a> - use if you want to use Ruby to write a Flash app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a> - use it if you want to integrate with .NET and/or write a silverlight app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> - use if you want to integrate with the Java world</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> - use it if you want to integrate with Cocoa/want a native OSX application</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com/">Maglev</a> - use if you want to use an object persistence layer and a distributed shared cache</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">REE</a> - use if you have a ruby 1.8 web app that uses too much memory</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> - use if you want to know what's going on in your code</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://smalltalk.felk.cvut.cz/projects/smallruby">SmallRuby</a> - don't use it yet, but keep an eye on it</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is the way I see the various existing implementations and I think this is where they shine and why they were created in the first place. They are all complimentary and help bring the Ruby language further. The goal is always the same.</p>

<p><strong>The future is exciting</strong></p>

<p>Ruby is getting everywhere or almost. Matz's Ruby is going to get multiVM support, various other improvements and get even faster and faster.
Alternative implementations are getting more and more mature and they grow the community by bringing people from different communities (.NET, java, obj-c/cocoa)</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we are all beneficiaries of the work done by all the implementers, thank you guys and keep up the good work!</p>

    <updated>2009-11-16T08:05:55+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/11/16/the-ruby-revolution-take-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_638" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi"]<img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GANDHI.jpg" alt="Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi" />[/caption]</p>

<p>My recent '<a href="http://merbist.com/2009/11/09/the-ruby-revolution-is-over">Ruby revolution being over</a>' blog post generated quite a <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/11/09/the-ruby-revolution-is-over/#comments">lot of comments</a>.
Let's be honest, I did not expect less from the readers.</p>

<p>However, I noticed three types of reactions I would like to address:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It was not a Ruby revolution, it was a Rails revolution</p></li>
<li><p>The revolution has stalled due to no major enterprise backing</p></li>
<li><p>The revolution will only be over when we will reach a greater adoption</p></li>
</ul>


<p>First of all, as <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/11/09/the-ruby-revolution-is-over/#comment-817">Joe correctly mentioned</a>, for me, the revolution is not about specifics or individuals. It's really about the big picture.</p>

<p>The influence Ruby had and still has on the IT world seems to be undermined by some.
Ruby is a dynamic, truly Object Oriented programming scripting language <strong>designed for humans first</strong>.
The real paradigm shift is in the fact that Ruby was designed to make programming fast, enjoyable and easy instead of being optimized for the machines running it.
This is for me the essence of the revolution and it is meant to transcend the scope of the Ruby language.</p>

<p>The way I see it, Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) is more of an artist than a technician. He had a vision for software development. <strong>Programming languages cannot be optimized/designed for both machines and humans, the language designer has to choose which one he wants to privilege.</strong></p>

<p>Most programming languages believe that it's up to the programmer to make an extra effort since he is smarter and easier to optimize than a machine. Matz questioned this approached and decided to turn things around. The result is one of the reasons why developers seem to just fall in love with Ruby.</p>

<h3>It was not a Ruby revolution, it was a Rails revolution.</h3>

<p>I am not denying that there <strong><em>also</em></strong> was a Rails revolution.
But if you look at it, Rails and its revolution are a direct effect from Ruby's revolution.
One might argue that it is actually an extension of Ruby's philosophy. But what is Rails if not a web framework designed to make web development fast, easy and enjoyable?
Without Ruby there would not have been Rails and that was my point, the underlying revolution comes from the language itself.</p>

<h3>The revolution has stalled due to no major enterprise backing.</h3>

<p>That's an interesting comment. It is true that .NET and Java are still dominating the enterprise world. But let's be clear, Ruby was not designed to please "suit people".
And to this day, there is still a strong feeling, from some individuals against the enterprise.
In the past, DHH openly said that he did not care nor wanted to hear about the enterprise, more recently, Obie Fernandez, during one of his talks said: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2733212">"Fuck the enterprise"</a> (49:39).
<strong>But the truth is that Ruby and the so called enterprise, both, are changing.</strong>
The smart people in the enterprise world saw potential in Ruby and decided to give it a chance. An easy way to include Ruby's philosophy without breaking the fragile enterprise equilibrium was to inject Ruby in the midst of well known and respected technologies such as Java and .NET. The enterprise can now use "re-branded Ruby versions" with "new taste or 'improved' flavor" like JRuby, Scala, groovy, IronRuby.
I work for some enterprise clients and I can tell you that they 'also' use Ruby. Mainly because developers love the language.
Microsoft, Apple and SAP investing in their own implementation of the language is yet another example that the enterprise recognizes the value of Matz's work.
Nobody can blame them to try to make Ruby fit more their requirements.
So, at the end of the day, Ruby is not the #1 enterprise language and Rails isn't used by the large majority of enterprise web apps, but that is NOT the point. Ruby has influenced the enterprise and we will see its effects for many years.</p>

<h3>The revolution will only be over when we will reach a greater adoption</h3>

<p>Saying that is missing the point entirely. A revolution is a step towards a situation change. Things don't change right away after a revolution. It takes a long time for mentalities to evolve and for people to change their habits.
The consequences of a revolution are to be studied over the decades following the event. Take smalltalk for instance. Smalltalk adoption was not that great, however it brought a paradigm shift that directly influenced languages such as Ruby, Python and Objective-C.
So, again, do not focus on the adoption but instead look at the influence of the Ruby revolution and the ripple effect around it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg/300px-Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg" alt="Liberté guidant le peuple - Eugene Delacroix posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>According to wikipedia, a <strong>revolution</strong> (from the latin <em>revolutio</em>, "a turn around") is a fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>Somehow, I believe this is exactly what Ruby has done in the programming world, especially with the help of Rails. Over the last few years, Ruby lead a mini revolution in the midst of software development. Thanks to Ruby, developers now look at software development differently. One thing for sure, it pushed DHH to write Rails and then convinced thousands of people to develop Ruby based applications on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>How did it happen?</h3>

<p>Let's take a look at history of revolutions. Some people get frustrated their situation, they try to find workarounds until it's just too much and the revolution kicks in.</p>

<p>Ruby came up with a new holistic perspective on things. Unlike most other programming languages, one of the main key value of Ruby is that writing code should feel right for the developer. You feel good about it because the language was written for humans and not machines. Basically, the language was designed to make you productive because it's designed to please you.</p>

<p>As people were discovering web 2.0, Ruby also came with an opinionated framework, pushing for productivity, testing, simplicity and elegance. People started to see a new way of doing things and it quickly became the new, cool technology. Rails became a buzz word, developers were hired to work on cool projects, and books were selling by the thousands.</p>

<h3>What did it change?</h3>

<p>If you ask my mom, she would probably say: nothing, except that now my son works from his home office and he seems to really enjoy what he does for living.</p>

<p>Relatively speaking, Ruby did not change the way we work or live. However, I believe that it has influenced many software developers around the globe. Why else do you think that companies like Microsoft, Apple or SAP are working on their own implementation of the Ruby language?</p>

<p>When I first discovered Ruby, I was amazed at how "right" it felt, at how much fun it was to write code using its syntax and idioms. Now, if I don't get that feeling when testing a programming language, I think there is something wrong.</p>

<p>The Ruby community also revived the Agile/XP world. Testing being a strong value of the community, we spent a lot of time discussing TDD, BDD, integration test as well as other practices such as pair programming, code review, sprints etc..</p>

<p>A few years ago, when people were asking me what programming language I would write their app in, I would reply Ruby and had to explain what it was, why it is great and would have to answer a lot of questions from potential clients. Nowadays, people don't even argue, sites like hulu.com, twitter.com, yellowpages.com and many others are written in Ruby and it's just part of the tools known to work very well.</p>

<h3>The revolution is over!</h3>

<p>Yes, Ruby made it's revolution and the world "has changed". But a real movement doesn't die after its revolution, that's actually when it has to be strong and defend its values.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that Ruby is dead or that Rails is "passé". To the contrary, Ruby imposed itself as a new valued and respected player, a new standard if you will.</p>

<p>Ruby is certainly not the "new kid in the block"anymore nor the "popular kid", however lots of older kids seem to want to have her on their team. (.NET, Java, Objective-C can all use Ruby)</p>

<p>The TDD + Ruby combo doesn't surprise anyone anymore and the Enterprise is slowly but surely adopting Ruby. Ruby is now just getting better, tools and libraries are improving and the amount of users is growing.</p>

<p>Certainly the Ruby community is still small compared to other software developer communities, but the fundamental change was done and we are now working on improvement and keeping things running smoothly, growing and getting new ideas inspired by our experience and other communities.</p>

<p>Long live Ruby!</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/25/macruby-browse-for-folder-or-file-dialog/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-25T15:52:14+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/25/macruby-browse-for-folder-or-file-dialog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is yet another pretty simple tip.
Use case: let say you want your applications users to choose one or multiple files or folder on their file system. A good example would be that you want the user to choose a file to process or a folder where to save some data.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20091025-nc89xd2ywqutqqddnwm2met3x4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the example above, I added a browse button and a text field.</p>

<p>I would like my users to click on the browse button, locate a folder and display it in the text field.</p>

<p>In your MacRuby controller, use a simple action method as well as an accessor to the text field:</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :destination_path

def browse(sender)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in Interface builder bind the destination_path outlet to the text field you want to use to display the path and bind the button to the browse action.</p>

<p>Let's go back to our action method and let's create a dialog panel, set some options and handle the user selection:</p>

<pre><code>def browse(sender)
  # Create the File Open Dialog class.
  dialog = NSOpenPanel.openPanel
  # Disable the selection of files in the dialog.
  dialog.canChooseFiles = false
  # Enable the selection of directories in the dialog.
  dialog.canChooseDirectories = true
  # Disable the selection of multiple items in the dialog.
  dialog.allowsMultipleSelection = false

  # Display the dialog and process the selected folder
  if dialog.runModalForDirectory(nil, file:nil) == NSOKButton
  # if we had a allowed for the selection of multiple items
  # we would have want to loop through the selection
    destination_path.stringValue = dialog.filenames.first
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>That's it, your user can now browse for a folder and the selection will be displayed in the text field. Look at the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSOpenPanel_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSOpenPanel documentation</a> for more details on the Cocoa API.</p>

    <updated>2009-10-23T10:17:45+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/23/railssummit-2009</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have had the opportunity to go to and speak at many conferences but this year was the first time I had the chance to go to <a href="http://railssummit.com.br">RailsSummit</a> in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<p>I was really looking forward to this trip and I have to say it went beyond my expectations. I had really good feedback from people like the <a href="http://www.phusion.nl/">Phusion guys</a> (Ninh &amp; Hongli), Gregg Pollack and others.</p>

<p>For those who don't know, RailsSummit is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, Ruby event in Latin America. It's organized yearly by <a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br/">Locaweb</a>, the #1 hosting company in Brazil (props to Akita &amp; Cristiane for their work).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/4027342992_789777fd03_m_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As part of my involvement in the Ruby community I have met a lot of Brazilians always willing to help and especially giving time to translate content. (A good example would be the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/pt/start">Portuguese version of the Rails wiki</a> or <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/">José Valim</a> GSOC contribution) However, I did not realize how fast Rails was growing over here.</p>

<p>To come back to the conference, I have to say it was one of the best conference I have gone to. Chad Fowler, who gave the opening keynote, later told me that it reminded him of the first Ruby conferences in the US . For me, what made a huge difference was the fact that it was a very positive conference. People were happy to be here, eager to share and you could feel the passion. Unfortunately, I missed the first few Ruby conferences, but I can totally imagine how must have been. Passionate people, not trying to push their products but instead, share the cool stuff they've been working on. This is exactly the feeling I had during this conference.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I don't understand Portuguese well enough or maybe it's just a cultural thing, but the people at the conference were just super friendly and always willing to help. I was really glad to meet those who have been using some of my work, some new people to Ruby and people who don't do Ruby but were just interested in knowing what was going on in the Ruby world.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2719/4027357802_1082f38090.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The schedule was pretty packed and the discussions very interesting, you could certainly feel the excitement in the air. Ruby seems to catching up quickly over there. Brazilian Rubyists seem to be very pragmatic and a good illustration of that was certainly made by <a href="http://improveit.com.br/en">Vinicus Teles</a>, Brazil Agile XPert, who shared tips on how to release a successful product.</p>

<p>I stayed a few days after the conference and went to visit the Rubyists in Rio. Rio is a great city. It has some of the best soccer players in the world and some seriously talented software developers. Ruby &amp; Rails are not just the new trendy startup secret to success, companies like globo.com, currently the largest TV network in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a> and the fourth largest in the world, also started using Ruby and Rails. I had the opportunity to visit their office and meet their teams. It's very exciting to see how they use Agile/XP and Ruby and how they seem to be so successful. But I will keep that for another post.</p>

<p>Overall, even though the actual traveling to/from Brazil was a bit long, RailsSummit was a blast. I really hope to be able to come back next year, and by then, hopefully my Portuguese will have improved.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/09/macruby-tips-capturing-keyboard-events/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-09T19:24:04+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/09/macruby-tips-capturing-keyboard-events</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are writing any type of games you might want your users to interact with your application using their keyboards.</p>

<p>This is actually not that hard. The approach is simple and fast forward if you are used to Cocoa.</p>

<p>Everything starts in Interface Builder, add a custom view instance to your window.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20091010-8tf834wf9se6y81h2jf7a7e5he.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now switch to your project and a new file with a class called KeyboardControlView and make in inherit from NSView. We are creating a subview of NSView so we will be able to make our top view "layer" use this subclass.</p>

<pre><code>class KeyboardControlView &lt; NSView
  attr_accessor :game_controller

  def acceptsFirstResponder
    true
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the example above, I added an attribute accessor. attr_accessor class method creates getters and setters. It's basically the same as writing:</p>

<pre><code> def game_controller=(value)
  @game_controller = value
end

def game_controller
  @game_controller
end
</code></pre>

<p>MacRuby is keeping an eye on these accessors and let bind outlets to them.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves, we'll keep that for another time.</p>

<p>Let's go back to our newly created class. Notice, we also added a method called <code>
[acceptsFirstResponder](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSResponder/acceptsFirstResponder)</code> and returns true. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSResponder/acceptsFirstResponder">acceptsFirstResponder</a> returns false by default.
But in this case we want it to return true so our new class instance can be first in the responder chain.</p>

<p>Now that our class is ready, let's go back to Interface Builder, select our new custom view and click on the inspector button.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20091010-1trkxhw2r2paaik3ipa4gtytgg.jpg" alt="" />
Click on the (i) icon and in the Class field choose our new KeyboardControlView.
Yep, our new class just shows up by magic, it's also called the lrz effect, just don't ask ;)
So now when our application starts, a new instance of our NSView class is created and Cocoa will call different methods based on events triggered.</p>

<p>The two methods we are interested in reimplementing are keyDown and keyUp. They get called when a key gets pressed or released.</p>

<pre><code>def keyDown(event)
  characters = event.characters
  if characters.length == 1 &amp;&amp; !event.isARepeat
    character = characters.characterAtIndex(0)
    if character == NSLeftArrowFunctionKey
      puts "LEFT pressed"
    elsif character == NSRightArrowFunctionKey
      puts "RIGHT pressed"
    elsif character == NSUpArrowFunctionKey
      puts "UP pressed"
    elsif character == NSDownArrowFunctionKey
      puts "DOWN pressed"
    end
  end
 super
end
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think the code above needs much explanation. The only things that you might not understand are 'event.isARepeat'. This method returns true if the user left his/her finger on the key. The other thing is the use of the 'super' call at the end of the method. Basically, we reopened a method that was already defined and we don't want to just overwrite it, we just want to inject out code within the existing method, so once we are done handling the event, we just pass it back to original method.</p>

<p>Final result:</p>

<pre><code>class KeyboardControlView &lt; NSView
  attr_accessor :game_controller

  def acceptsFirstResponder
    true
  end

  def keyDown(event)
    characters = event.characters
    if characters.length == 1 &amp;&amp; !event.isARepeat
      character = characters.characterAtIndex(0)
      if character == NSLeftArrowFunctionKey
        puts "LEFT pressed"
      elsif character == NSRightArrowFunctionKey
        puts "RIGHT pressed"
      elsif character == NSUpArrowFunctionKey
        puts "UP pressed"
      elsif character == NSDownArrowFunctionKey
    puts "DOWN pressed"
      end
    end
    super
  end

  # Deals with keyboard keys being released
  def keyUp(event)
    characters = event.characters
    if characters.length == 1
      character = characters.characterAtIndex(0)
      if character == NSLeftArrowFunctionKey
       puts "LEFT released"
      elsif character == NSRightArrowFunctionKey
        puts "RIGHT released"
      elsif character == NSUpArrowFunctionKey
       puts "UP released"
      elsif character == NSDownArrowFunctionKey
        puts "DOWN released"
      end
    end
    super
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's up to you to handle the other keystrokes and do whatever you want. That's it for this tip, I hope it helps.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/07/macruby-0-5-beta-1-and-textorize/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-07T20:45:02+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/07/macruby-0-5-beta-1-and-textorize</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good news everyone!</p>

<p>MacRuby beta 1 has been released! <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2009/10/07/macruby05b1.html">Official announcement here</a>.</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="144" caption="Download MacRuby 0.5 beta1"]<a href="http://www.macruby.org/files/MacRuby%200.5%20beta%201.zip"><img src="http://www.macruby.org/images/zip.png" alt="Download MacRuby 0.5 beta1" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Note that the download is only for SnowLeopard, intel machines.</p>

<p>Lots of great stuff in this new release, the first one based on LLVM. Check the <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2009/10/07/macruby05b1.html">Laurent's post</a> to learn more about the work done on compilation, optimization, concurrency, compatibility and Cocoa interaction. And a big thank you to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVgM7qeAlko">Laurent Sansonetti</a> who is putting so much effort in this project!</p>

<p>However, don't forget it's still a beta release and you might encounter bugs. Feel free to report them in the bug tracker or ask on the mailing list.</p>

<p>On a different topic, the other day, John Gruber from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/09/30/textorize">wrote a quick note</a> about <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/2009/09/29/textorize-pristine-font-rendering-for-the-web/">Thomas Fuchs' textorize script</a> which since got its own place on the internet <a href="http://textorize.org/">http://textorize.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Textorize is a Ruby-based font rasterizer command line utility for Mac OS X. It generates PNG files from an input string and options, using Mac OS X's pristine typography facilities. As John said, it's a case where a few lines of Ruby code beat Photoshop.</p>

<p>Thomas version is based on RubyCocoa which is great... but not MacRuby.</p>

<p>To celebrate<a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2009/10/07/macruby05b1.html"> MacRuby 0.5 beta1</a>, I ported the gem over and pushed it to the excellent <a href="http://gemcutter.org/">gemcutter.org facility</a>.</p>

<p>After installing MacRuby beta, follow these directives:</p>

<pre><code>$ macgem sources -a http://gemcutter.org
$ sudo macgem install textorize-mr
$ textorize -f"Didot" -s200 "MacRuby 0.5b1"
$ open output.png
</code></pre>

<p>And you will get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_antialiasing">subpixel antialiased</a> fancy bitmap like that:</p>

<p><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/macruby05b1.png" alt="macruby05b1" /></p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/06/macruby-tips-how-to-play-an-audio-file/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-06T19:00:08+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/06/macruby-tips-how-to-play-an-audio-file</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let's say you would like to play an audio file in your MacRuby app/script, how would you do?
It's actually pretty simple, you just need to use NSSound. If we wanted to use a system sound we could do:</p>

<pre><code>NSSound.soundNamed('Basso').play
</code></pre>

<p>But let's look at a more advanced example with some Cocoa patterns. We will loop through all the audio files in a folder and we will play them one after the other.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env macruby
framework 'Cocoa'
# Cocoa documentation reference:
# http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSSound_Class/Reference/Reference.html

def play_sound
  if @sounds.empty?
    NSApplication.sharedApplication.terminate(nil)
  else
    sound_file = @sounds.shift
    s = NSSound.alloc.initWithContentsOfFile(sound_file, byReference: false)
    puts "previewing #{sound_file}"
    s.delegate = self
    s.play
  end
end

# This is a delegate method called by the sound object
def sound(sound, didFinishPlaying: state)
  play_sound if state
end

# Delegate method called when the app finished loading
def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)
  @sounds = Dir.glob("/System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff")
  play_sound
end

# We are delegating the application to self so the script will know when
# it finished loading
NSApplication.sharedApplication.delegate = self
NSApplication.sharedApplication.run
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine, I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>$ macruby macrubysound.rb
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Blow.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Bottle.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Frog.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Morse.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Purr.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Sosumi.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff
previewing /System/Library/Sounds/Tink.aiff
</code></pre>

<p>Cocoa delegation might seem a bit strange at first when you come from Ruby. In Ruby we rarely do any type of async delegation so let's quickly look at what's going on in this script.</p>

<p>The first thing we do is loading the cocoa framework which makes total sense, then we define a bunch of methods and finally we get to:</p>

<pre><code>NSApplication.sharedApplication.delegate = self
NSApplication.sharedApplication.run
</code></pre>

<p>We are setting the run loop to delegate to set, which means that when an event is triggered, the delegation method will be called on self (our script).
Once that done, we are starting out run loop.</p>

<p>Once the application is loaded the applicationDidFinishLaunching delegate is being triggered (line 24). At this point, we are looking for all the sound files in the sound system folder and storing them in an instance variable (line 25). Finally, we are calling the play_sound method (line 26).</p>

<p>The play_sound method checks that we have some audio files left to play (line 7), otherwise it quits the app. (line 8 ) If we still have some files in the queue, we get the first one (line 10) and use it to create an instance of NSSound (line 11).</p>

<p>Before playing the NSSound instance, we are setting its delegate to our script (self) (line 13). If you read <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSSound_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSSound Cocoa documentation</a> for #play, you will notice that #play "initiates playback asynchronously and returns control to your application. Therefore, your application can continue doing work while the audio is playing." In our case, we don't want to do that, otherwise all the sounds will play at the same time.</p>

<p>The documentation also mentions a delegation you can use to avoid that. This is exactly what we did when we implemented:  def sound(sound, didFinishPlaying: state) (line 19)</p>

<p>Rubyists might be surprised by the method signature. MacRuby extended Ruby to support Objective-C selectors.</p>

<p>When the sound is playing, this delegate gets called, we check on the state of the sound, if it finished playing then we call play_sound again.</p>

<p>That's it!  It's a very elegant implementation giving us the benefits of both Ruby and Cocoa.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/06/macruby-tips-embed-a-custom-font/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-06T09:23:44+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/06/macruby-tips-embed-a-custom-font</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let say you want to release your MacRuby app and use a custom embedded font?
You probably don't want to force your users to install the font.
Well, don't worry, just put the font file in your resources folder and use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>font_location = NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResource('MyCustomFont', ofType: 'ttf')
font_url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(font_location)
# in MacRuby, always make sure that cocoa constants start by an uppercase
CTFontManagerRegisterFontsForURL(font_url, KCTFontManagerScopeProcess, nil)
</code></pre>

<p>That's it, now your custom font is available and you can change your textfield instance's font like that:</p>

<pre><code>text_field.font = NSFont.fontWithName('MyCustomFont', size:24)
</code></pre>

<p>The only tricky things here were to know the Cocoa API call and to know that even if the Cocoa API references the constant to use as kCTFontManagerScopeProcess, because in Ruby, constants start by an uppercase, you need to convert it to: KCTFontManagerScopeProcess.</p>

    <link href="http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/05/macruby-soon-to-reach-a-new-milestone/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-05T23:58:53+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mattetti.github.com/posts/2009/10/05/macruby-soon-to-reach-a-new-milestone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Laurent just posted a <a href="http://bit.ly/2YPwRT">MacRuby status update</a> on the mailing list and the first official beta of MacRuby 0.5 should be released pretty soon.</p>

<p>Let's quickly look at Laurent's report:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Early backtracing support.</p></li>
<li><p>Much better AOT compilation. Parts of the standard library are now pre-compiled for testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrated to LLVM top of tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Dispatcher performance is now back to normal (we lost about 30% due to gcc not inlining code).</p></li>
<li><p>Many bug fixes.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In lay terms, backtracing is what you see when your app crashes or has a problem, it's the list of methods called before the exception was raised and the line where the error happened. Currently the backtrace is similar to what you would have with Ruby 1.9, however objective-c exceptions are not supported and there is still some work to do.</p>

<p>AOT compilation or Ahead Of Time compilation is the process of compiling a script into machine code. I already covered that <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/07/12/compiled-hello-world-with-macruby/">feature earlier</a>. Progress has been made and now some Ruby standard libraries are now pre-compiled in MacRuby. The two main advantages of doing AOT compilation are startup speed and obfuscation. Two important features for desktop applications or for when you want to license your server app.</p>

<p>Updating LLVM doesn't mean much for end users. With the support of the MacRuby team, <a href="http://www.icoretech.org/">Claudio</a> setup a nightly build bot <a href="http://macruby.icoretech.org/">http://macruby.icoretech.org/</a> allowing you to download nightly builds for SnowLeopard. The app is a <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra app</a> that could can checkout on github:  <a href="http://github.com/masterkain/macruby-nightlies-web">http://github.com/masterkain/macruby-nightlies-web</a> What's interesting is that Apple is sponsoring both LLVM and MacRuby which will hopefully bring some synergy and help both projects.</p>

<p>Fixed dispatcher, this is a just a perf bug fix only affecting people on trunk.</p>

<p>I personally used MacRuby quite a lot recently. I have been writing a 2D video game for my <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/153-writing-2-d-games-for-the-osx-platform-in-ruby">RubyConf talk</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20091006-kj64ix4up5q8dh4yin38hjrjcp.jpg" alt="" />It's a simple game only using Ruby and Cocoa. It's not a fancy game and, no, it doesn't run on the iPhone yet ;)</p>

<p>I never wrote a game in Cocoa and I decided not to use an existing framework like Gosu or cocos2d, instead I decided to write everything from scratch. Using CoreAnimation instead of OpenGL, the task wasn't that hard at all. in less than 1,000 LOC (before refactoring), I have a fully working game.</p>

<p>I will be previewing the game at <a href="http://www.railssummit.com.br/">RailsSummit</a> and will show the code and explain how to get there at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/153-writing-2-d-games-for-the-osx-platform-in-ruby">RubyConf</a>.</p>

<p>When I started getting involved with MacRuby, I really did not think I would write a video game in Ruby and actually enjoy it. At the end of the day, I will more than likely use MacRuby for desktop/mobile/server apps more than games, but it's awesome to be able to use your favorite language to do other things than what you are usually paid to do.</p>

<p>MacRuby is coming along very nicely, and I'm really excited about the multitude of new options offered to Ruby developers on OSX and can't wait for 0.5 final and see what people will do with it.</p>
