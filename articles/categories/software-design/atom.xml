    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most modern web applications start as a monolithic code base and, as complexity increases, the once small app gets split apart into many "modules". In other cases, engineers opt for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA</a> design approach from the beginning. One way or another, we start running multiple separate applications that need to interact seamlessly. My goal will be to describe some of the high-level challenges and solutions found in implementing a Single-Sign-On service.</p>

<h2>Authentication vs Authorization</h2>

<p>I wish these two words didn't share the same root because it surely confuses a lot of people. My most frequently-discussed example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>. Every time I start talking about implementing a centralized/unified authentication system, someone jumps in and suggests that we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>. The challenge is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a> is an authorization system, not an authentication system.</p>

<p>It's tricky, because you might actually be "authenticating" yourself to website X using OAuth. What you are really doing is allowing website X to use your information stored by the OAuth provider. It is true that OAuth offers a pseudo-authentication approach via its provider but that is not the main goal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>: the Auth in OAuth stands for Authorization, not Authentication.</p>

<p>Here is how we could briefly describe each role:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authentication</strong>: recognizes who you are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authorization</strong>: know what you are allowed to do, or what you allow others to do.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you are feel stuck in your design and something seems wrong, ask yourself if you might be confused by the 2 auth words. This article will only focus on <strong>authentication</strong>.</p>

<h2>A Common Scenario</h2>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-simplescenario.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-simplescenario.png" alt="SSO diagram with 3 top applications connecting to an authorization service." /></a></p>

<p>This is probably the most common structure, though I made it slightly more complex by drawing the three main apps in different programming languages. We have three web applications running on different subdomains and sharing account data via a centralized authentication service.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep authentication and basic account data isolated.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow users to stay logged in while browsing different apps.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Implementing such a system should be easy. That said, if you migrate an existing app to an architecture like that, you will spend 80% of your time decoupling your legacy code from authentication and wondering what data should be centralized and what should be distributed. Unfortunately, I can't tell you what to do there since this is very domain specific. Instead, let's see how to do the "easy part."</p>

<h2>Centralizing and Isolating Shared Account Data</h2>

<p>At this point, you more than likely have each of your apps talk directly to shared database tables that contain user account data. The first step is to migrate away from doing that. We need a single interface that is the only entry point to create or update shared account data. Some of the data we have in the database might be app specific and therefore should stay within each app, anything that is shared across apps should be moved behind the new interface.</p>

<p>Often your centralized authentication system will store the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ID</p></li>
<li><p>first name</p></li>
<li><p>last name</p></li>
<li><p>login/nickname</p></li>
<li><p>email</p></li>
<li><p>hashed password</p></li>
<li><p>salt</p></li>
<li><p>creation timestamp</p></li>
<li><p>update timestamp</p></li>
<li><p>account state (verified, disabled ...)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Do not duplicate this data in each app, instead have each app rely on the account ID to query data that is specific to a given account in the app. Technically that means that instead of using SQL joins, you will query your database using the ID as part of the condition.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to do things slowly but surely. Migrate your database schema piece by piece assuring that everything works fine. Once the other pieces will be in place, you can migrate one code API a time until your entire code base is moved over. You might want to change your DB credentials to only have read access, then no access at all.</p>

<h2>Login workflow</h2>

<p>Each of our apps already has a way for users to login. We don't want to change the user experience, instead we want to make a transparent modification so the authentication check is done in a centralized way instead of a local way. To do that, the easiest way is to keep your current login forms but instead of POSTing them to your local apps, we'll POST them to a centralized authentication API. (SSL is strongly recommended)</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login.png" alt="diagram showing the login workflow" /></a></p>

<p>As shown above, the login form now submits to an endpoint in the authentication application. The form will more than likely include a login or email and a clear text password as well as a hidden callback/redirect url so that the authentication API can redirect the user's browser to the original app. For security reasons, you might want to white list the domains you allow your authentication app to redirect to.</p>

<p>Internally, the Authentication app will validate the identifier (email or login) using a hashed version of the clear password against the matching record in the account data. If the verification is successful, a token will be generated containing some user data (for instance: id, first name, last name, email, created date, authentication timestamp). If the verification failed, the token isn't generated. Finally the user's browser is redirected to the callback/redirect URL provided in the request with the token being passed.</p>

<p>You might want to safely encrypt the data in a way that allows the clients to verify and trust that the token comes from a trusted source. A great solution for that would be to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm">RSA encryption</a>) with the public key available in all your client apps but the private key only available on the auth server(s). Other strong encryption solutions would also work. For instance, another appropriate approach would be to add a signature to the params sent back. This way the clients could check the authenticity of the params. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a> signature are great for that but in some cases, you don't want people to see the content of the data you send back. That's especially true if you are sending back a 'mobile' token for instance. But that's a different story. What's important to consider is that we need a way to ensure that the data sent back to the client can't be tampered with. You might also make sure you prevent replay attacks.</p>

<p>On the other side, the application receives a GET request with a token param. If the token is empty or can't be decrypted, authentication failed. At that point, we need to show the user the login page again and let him/her try again. If on the other hand, the token can be decrypted, the content should be saved in the session so future requests can reuse the data.</p>

<p>We described the authentication workflow, but if a user logins in application X, (s)he won't be logged-in in application Y or Z. The trick here, is to set a top level domain cookie that can be seen by all applications running on subdomains. Certainly, this solution only works for apps being on the same domain, but we'll see later how to handle apps on different domains.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login-cookie.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-login-cookie.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The cookie doesn't need to contain a lot of data, its value can contain the account id, a timestamp (to know when authentication happened and a trusted signature) and a signature. The signature is critical here since this cookie will allow users to be automatically logged in other sites. I'd recommend the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a> encryptions to generate the signature. The DSA encryption, very much like the RSA encryption is an asymmetrical encryption relying on a public/private key. This approach offers more security than having something based a shared secret like HMAC does. But that's really up to you.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to set a filter in your application. This auto-login filter will check the presence of an auth cookie on the top level domain and the absence of local session. If that's the case, a session is automatically created using the user id from the cookie value after the cookie integrity is verified. We could also share the session between all our apps, but in most cases, the data stored by each app is very specific and it's safer/cleaner to keep the sessions isolated. The integration with an app running on a different service will also be easier if the sessions are isolated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>For registration, as for login, we can take one of two approaches: point the user's browser to the auth API or make S2S (server to server) calls from within our apps to the Authentication app. POSTing a form directly to the API is a great way to reduce duplicated logic and traffic on each client app so I'll demonstrate this approach.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CopyofSSO-register.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CopyofSSO-register.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the approach is the same we used to login. The difference is that instead of returning a token, we just return some params (id, email and potential errors). The redirect/callback url will also obviously be different than for login. You could decide to encrypt the data you send back, but in this scenario, what I would do is set an auth cookie at the .domain.com level when the account is created so the "client" application can auto-login the user. The information sent back in the redirect is used to re-display the register form with the error information and the email entered by the user.</p>

<p>At this point, our implementation is almost complete. We can create an account and login using the defined credentials. Users can switch from one app to another without having to re login because we are using a shared signed cookie that can only be created by the authentication app and can be verified by all "client" apps. Our code is simple, safe and efficient.</p>

<h2>Updating or deleting an account</h2>

<p>The next thing we will need is to update or delete an account. In this case, this is something that needs to be done between a "client" app and the authentication/accounts app. We'll make S2S (server to server) calls. To ensure the security of our apps and to offer a nice way to log requests, API tokens/keys will be used by each client to communicate with the authentication/accounts app. The API key can be passed using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">X-header</a> so this concern stays out of the request params and our code can process separately the authentication via X-header and the actual service implementation. S2S services should have a filter verifying and logging the API requests based on the key sent with the request. The rest is straight forward.</p>

<h2>Using different domains</h2>

<p>Until now, we assumed all our apps were on the same top domain. In reality, you will often find yourself with apps on different domains. This means that you can't use the shared signed cookie approach anymore. However, there is a simple trick that will allow you to avoid requiring your users to re-login as they switch apps.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-differentdomains-1.png"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SSO-differentdomains-1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The trick consists, when a local session isn't present, of using an iframe in the application using the different domain. The iframe loads a page from the authentication/accounts app which verifies that a valid cookie was set on the main top domain. If that is the case, we can tell the application that the user is already globally logged in and we can tell the iframe host to redirect to an application end point passing an auth token the same way we did during the authentication. The app would then create a session and redirect the user back to where (s)he started. The next requests will see the local session and this process will be ignored.</p>

<p>If the authentication application doesn't find a signed cookie, the iframe can display a login form or redirect the iframe host to a login form depending on the required behavior.</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind when using multiple apps and domains is that you need to keep the shared cookies/sessions in sync, meaning that if you log out from an app, you need to also delete the auth cookie to ensure that users are globally logged out. (It also means that you might always want to use an iframe to check the login status and auto-logoff users).</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Mobile clients</h2>

<p>Another part of implementing a SSO solution is to handle mobile clients. Mobile clients need to be able to register/login and update accounts. However, unlike S2S service clients, mobile clients should only allow calls to modify data on the behalf of a given user. To do that, I recommend providing opaque mobile tokens during the login process. This token can then be sent with each request in a X-header so the service can authenticate the user making the request. Again, SSL is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>In this approach, we don't use a cookie and we actually don't need a SSO solution, but an unified authentication system.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Writing web services</h2>

<p>Our Authentication/Accounts application turns out to be a pure web API app.</p>

<p>We also have 3 sets of APIs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public APIs: can be accessed from anywhere, no authentication required</p></li>
<li><p>S2S APIs: authenticated via API keys and only available to trusted clients</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile APIs: authenticated via a mobile token and limited in scope.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We don't need dynamic HTML views, just simple web service related code. While this is a little bit off topic, I'd like to take a minute to show you how I personally like writing web service applications.</p>

<p>Something that I care a lot about when I implement web APIs is to validate incoming params. This is an opinionated approach that I picked up while at Sony and that I think should be used every time you implement a web API. As a matter of fact, I wrote a Ruby <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/Weasel-Diesel">DSL library (Weasel Diesel)</a> allowing you <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/blob/master/api/hello_world.rb">describe a given service</a>, its <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/blob/master/api/hello_world.rb#L7">incoming params</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/blob/master/api/hello_world.rb#L10-15">expected output</a>. This DSL is hooked into a web backend so you can implement services using a web engine such as <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> or maybe Rails3. Based on the DSL usage, incoming parameters are be verified before being processed. The other advantage is that you can generate documentation based on the API description as well as automated tests.</p>

<p>You might be familiar with <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, another DSL for web services. Besides the obvious style difference <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/Weasel-Diesel">Weasel Diesel </a>offers the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>input validation/sanitization</p></li>
<li><p>service isolation</p></li>
<li><p>generated documentation</p></li>
<li><p>contract based design</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a hello world webservice being implemented using Weasel Diesel and Sinatra:</p>

<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/2300131[/gist]</p>

<p>Basis test validating the contract defined in the DSL and the actual output when the service is called:</p>

<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/2300440[/gist]</p>

<p>Generated documentation:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120404-t1j93b73tef5pmd5idfqqa61td.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the DSL and its features seem appealing to you and you are interested in digging more into it, the easiest way is to fork <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/sinatra-web-api-example/">this demo repo</a> and start writing your own services.</p>

<p>The DSL has been used in production for more than a year, but there certainly are tweaks and small changes that can make the user experience even better. Feel free to fork the <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/Weasel-Diesel">DSL repo</a> and send me Pull Requests.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-29T07:48:08+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2012/02/29/learning-from-rails-failures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ruby on Rails undisputedly changed the way web frameworks are designed. Rails became a reference when it comes to leveraging conventions, easy baked in feature set and a rich ecosystem. However, I think that Rails did and still does a lot of things pretty poorly.  By writing this post, I'm not trying to denigrate Rails, there are many other people out there already doing that. My hope is that by listing what I think didn't and still doesn't go well, we can learn from our mistakes and improve existing solutions or create better new ones.</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/2012/02/29/learning-from-rails-failures/train_fail/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/train_fail-300x188.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2>Migration/upgrades</h2>

<p>Migrating a Rails App from a version to the other is very much like playing the lottery, you are almost sure you will lose. To be more correct, you know things will break, you just don't know what, when and how. The Rails team seems to think that everybody is always running on the cutting edge version and don't consider people who prefer to stay a few version behind for stability reasons. What's worse is that plugins/gems might or might not compatible with the version you are updating to, but you will only know that by trying yourself and letting others try and report potential issues.</p>

<p>This is for me, by far, the biggest issue with Rails and something that should have been fixed a long time ago. If you're using the WordPress blog engine, you know how easy and safe it is to upgrade the engine or the plugins. Granted WordPress isn't a web dev framework, but it gives you an idea of what kind of experience we should be striving for.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Stability vs playground zone</h2>

<p>New features are cool and they help make the platform more appealing to new comers. They also help shape the future of a framework. But from my perspective, that shouldn't come to the cost of stability. Rails 3's new asset pipeline is a good example of a half-baked solution shoved in a release at the last minute and creating a nightmare for a lot of us trying to upgrade. I know, I know, you can turn off the asset pipeline and it got better since it was first released. But shouldn't that be the other way around? Shouldn't fun new ideas risking the stability of an app or making migration harder, be off by default and turned on only by people wanting to experiment? When your framework is young, it's normal that you move fast and sometimes break, but once it matures, these things shouldn't happen.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Public/private/plugin APIs</h2>

<p>This is more of a recommendation than anything else. When you write a framework in a very dynamic language like Ruby, people will "monkey patch" your code to inject features. Sometimes it is due to software design challenges, sometimes it's because people don't know better. However,  by not explicitly specifying what APIs are private (they can change at anytime, don't touch), what APIs are public (stable, will be slowly deprecated when they need to be changed) and which ones are for plugin devs only (APIs meant for instrumentation, extension etc..), you are making migration to newer versions much harder. You see, if you have a small, clean public API, then it's easy to see what could break, warn developers and avoid migration nightmares. However, you need to start doing that early on in your project, otherwise you will end up like Rails where all code can potentially change anytime.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Rails/Merb merge was a mistake</h2>

<p>This is my personal opinion and well, feel free to disagree, nobody will ever be able to know to for sure. Without explaining what happened behind closed doors and the various personal motivations, looking at the end result, I agree with the group of people thinking that the merge didn't turn up to be a good thing. For me, Rails 3 isn't significantly better than Rails 2 and it took forever to be released. You still can't really run a mini Rails stack like promised. I did hear that Strobe (company who was hiring Carl Lerche, Yehuda Katz and contracted Jose Valim) used to have an ActionPack based, mini stack but it was never released and apparently only Rails core members really knew what was going on there. Performance in vanilla Rails 3 are only now getting close to what you had with Rails 2 (and therefore far from the perf you were getting with Merb). Thread-safety is still OFF by default meaning that by default your app uses a giant lock only allowing a process to handle 1 request at a time. For me, the flexibility and performance focus of Merb were mainly lost in the merge with Rails. (Granted, some important things such as ActiveModel, cleaner internals and others have made their way into Rails 3)</p>

<p>But what's worse than everything listed so far is that the lack of competition and the internal rewrites made Rails lose its headstart.  Rails is very much HTML/view focused, its primarily strength is to make server side views trivial and it does an amazing job at that. But let's be honest, that's not the future for web dev. The future is more and more logic pushed to run on the client side (in JS) and the server side being used as an API serving data for the view layer. I'm sorry but adding support for CoffeeScript doesn't really do much to making Rails evolve ahead of what it currently is. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of CoffeeScript, that said I still find that Rails is far from being optimized to developer web APIs in Rails. You can certainly do it, but you are basically using a tool that wasn't designed to write APIs and you pay the overhead for that. If there is one thing I wish Rails will get better at is to make writing pure web APIs better (thankfully there is Sinatra). But at the end of the day, I think that two projects with different philosophies and different approaches are really hard to merge, especially in the open source world. I wouldn't go as far as saying like others that Rails lost its sexiness to node.js because of the wasted time, but I do think that things would have been better for all if that didn't happen. However, I also have to admit that I'm not sure how much of a big deal that is. I prefer to leave the past behind, learn from my own mistake and move on.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Technical debts</h2>

<p>Here I'd like to stop to give a huge props to Aaron "<a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a>" Patterson, the man who's actively working to reduce the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debts</a> in the Rails code base. This is a really hard job and definitely not a very glamorous one. He's been working on various parts of Rails including its router and its ORM (ActiveRecord). Technical debts are unfortunately normal in most project, but sometimes they are overwhelming to the point that nobody dares touching the code base to clean it up. This is a hard problem, especially when projects move fast like Rails did. But looking back, I think that you want to start tackling technical debts on the side as you move on so you avoid getting to the point that you need a hero to come up and clean the piled errors made in the past. But don't pause your entire project to clean things up otherwise you will lose market, momentum and excitement. I feel that this is also very much true for any legacy project you might pick up as a developer.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Keep the cost of entry level low</h2>

<p>Getting started with Rails used to be easier. This can obviously argued since it's very subjective, but from my perspective I think we forgot where we come from and we involuntary expect new comers to come with unrealistic knowledge. Sure, Rails does much more than it used to do, but it's also much harder to get started. I'm not going to argue how harder  it is now or why we got there. Let's just keep in mind that it is a critical thing that should always be re-evaluated. Sure, it's harder when you have an open source project, but it's also up to the leadership to show that they care and to encourage and mentor volunteers to  focus on this important part of a project.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Rails documentation isn't bad, but it's far from being great. Documentation certainly isn't one of the Ruby's community strength, especially compared with the Python community, but what saddens me is to see the state of <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">the official documentation</a> which, should, in theory be the reference. Note that the Rails guides are usually well written and provide value, but they too often seem too light and not useful when you try to do something not totally basic (for instance use an ActiveModel compliant object). That's probably why most people don't refer to them or don't spend too much time there. I'm not trying to blame anyone there. I think that the people who contributed theses guides did an amazing job, but if you want to build a strong and easy to access community, great documentation is key. Look at the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/">Django</a> documentation as a good example. That said, I also need to acknowledge the amazing job done by many community members such as <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Ryan Bates</a> and <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl</a> consistently providing high value external documentation via the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">railscasts</a> and the intro to <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Rails tutorial</a> available for free.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In conclusion, I think that there is a lot to learn from Rails, lots of great things as well as lots of things you would want to avoid. We can certainly argue on Hacker News or via comments about whether or not I'm right about Rails failures, my point will still be that the mentioned issues should be avoided in any projects, Rails here is just an example. Many of these issues are currently being addressed by the Rails team but wouldn't it be great if new projects learn from older ones and avoid making the same mistakes? So what other mistakes do you think I forgot to mention and that one should be very careful of avoiding?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I did some quick digging into how ORM objects are initialized and the performance cost associated to that. In other words, I wanted to see what's going on when you initialize an ActiveRecord object.</p>

<p>Before I show you the benchmark numbers and you jump to conclusions, it's important to realize that in the grand scheme of things, the performance cost we are talking is small enough that it is certainly not the main reason why your application is slow. Spoiler alert: ActiveRecord is slow but the cost of initialization isn't by far the worse part of ActiveRecord. Also, even though this article doesn't make activeRecord look good, and I'm not trying to diss it. It's a decent ORM that does a great job in most cases.</p>

<p>Let's get started by the benchmarks number to give us an idea of the damage (using Ruby 1.9.3 p125):</p>

<p> </p>

<pre><code>                                                             | Class | Hash  | AR 3.2.1 | AR no protection | Datamapper | Sequel |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.new() x100000                                               | 0.037 | 0.049 | 1.557    | 1.536            | 0.027      | 0.209  |
.new({:id=&gt;1, :title=&gt;"Foo", :text=&gt;"Bar"}) x100000          | 0.327 | 0.038 | 6.784    | 5.972            | 4.226      | 1.986  |
</code></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>You can see that I am comparing the allocation of a Class instance, a Hash and some ORM models. The benchmark suite tests the allocation of an empty object and one with passed attributes. The benchmark in question is available <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/init_objects.rb">here</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see there seems to be a huge performance difference between allocating a basic class and an ORM class. Instantiating an ActiveRecord class is 20x slower than instantiating a normal class, while ActiveRecord offers some extra features, why is it so much slower, especially at initialization time?</p>

<p>The best way to figure it out is to profile the initialization. For that, I used <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb">perftools.rb</a> and I generated a graph of the call stack.</p>

<p>Here is what Ruby does (and spends its time) when you initialize a new Model instance (click to download the PDF version):</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_init_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AR-model-instantation-by-Matt-Aimonetti.jpg" alt="Profiler diagram of AR model instantiation by Matt Aimonetti" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is quite a scary graph but it shows nicely the features you are getting and their cost associated. For instance, the option of having the before and after initialization callback cost you 14% of your CPU time per instantiation, even though you probably almost never use these callbacks. I'm reading that by interpreting the node called ActiveSupport::Callback#run_callbacks, 3rd level from the top. So 14.1% of the CPU time is spent trying to run callbacks. As a quick note, note that 90.1% of the CPU time is spent initializing objects, the rest is spent in the loop and in the garbage collection (because the profiler runs many loops). You can then follow the code and see how the code works, creating a dynamic class callback method on the fly (the one with the long name) and then recreating the name of this callback to call it each time the object is allocated. It sounds like that's a good place for some micro optimizations which could yield up to 14% performance increase in some cases.</p>

<p>Another major part of the CPU time is spent in ActiveModel's sanitization. This is the piece of code that allows you to block some model attributes to be mass assigned. This is useful when you don't want to sanitize your incoming params but want to create or update a model instance by using all the passed user params. To avoid malicious users to modify some specific params that might be in your model but not in your form, you can protect these attributes. A good example would be an admin flag on a User object. That said, if you manually initialize an instance, you don't need this extra protection, that's why in the benchmark above, I tested and without the protection. As you can see, it makes quite a big difference. The profiler graph of the same initialization without the mass assignment protection logically ends up looking quite different:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/glv">Glenn Vanderburg</a> pointed out that some people might assuming that the shown code path is called for each record loaded from the database. This isn't correct, the graph represents instances allocated by calling #new. See the addition at the bottom of the post for more details about what's going on when you fetch data from the DB.</p>

<p>I then decided to look at the graphs for the two other popular Ruby ORMs:</p>

<p><a href="http://datamapper.org/">Datamapper</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/dm_init_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120223-txs4wa7b5rdpg45aj6354xg1wt.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>and <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/sequel_init_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120223-p2jx6ypk35ucsgtx7p1tcabpes.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>While I didn't give you much insight in ORM code, I hope that this post will motivate you to sometimes take a look under the cover and profile your code to see what's going on and why it might be slow. <strong>Never assume, always measure</strong>. Tools such as perftools are a great way to get a visual feedback and get a better understanding of how the Ruby interpreter is handling your code.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>I heard you liked graphs so I added some more, here is what's going on when you do Model.first:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_first_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120224-f23s8xctghi8mj6ax3cdw9aq25.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Model.all</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_all_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20120224-q29q4n7bj3i96erk1enxdqxb5e.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>And finally this is the code graph for a call to Model.instantiate which is called after a record was retrieved from the database to convert into an Object. (You can see the #instantiate call referenced in the graph above).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mattetti/benchmarks/blob/master/ar_instantiate_profile.pdf?raw=true"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20120224-8scmun9n1c9ufdnxa8rq2961bq.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

    <link href="http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2011/07/11/first-step-in-scaling-a-web-site-http-caching/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-11T10:21:02+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2011/07/11/first-step-in-scaling-a-web-site-http-caching</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/mokolabs">Patrick Crowley</a> and I were talking about scaling his website: <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/">http://cinematreasures.org</a> since an article covering his work will soon be published in a very popular newspaper. Patrick's site is hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> which comes by default with <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish caching</a> enabled.</p>

<p>The challenge is that a lot of people using the Rails framework are used to doing page caching instead of relying on HTTP caching, even though this feature was added a long time ago. The major problem with page caching is that it doesn't scale that well as soon as you run more than one server. Indeed you would need to store the page content to a shared drive between your servers or use memcached and do some work to avoid hitting your app every single time. On the other hand, HTTP caching is extremely easy to handle at the application level and it will dramatically reduce the amount of requests hitting your app. Let me explain a little more about HTTP caching.</p>

<p>Ryan Tomako wrote an <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do">excellent post</a> about the details of caching, I strongly recommend you <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do">read it</a>. In a nutshell, the HTTP caching layer (usually) seats before your application layer and allows you, the developer to store some responses that can be send back to the users based on optional conditions. That might still seem vague, let's take a concrete example. If you look at <a href="http://cinematreasures.org">http://cinematreasures.org</a>'s home page you can see that it's an agglomerate of various information:</p>

<p><a href="http://cinematreasures.org"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110709-dnxjhikxr14tdr7e35n97madhn.jpg" alt="CinemaTreasures homepage" /></a></p>

<p>And the bottom of the page contains even more dynamic data such as the popular movie theater photos, latest movie theater videos and latest tweets. One might look at that and say that this page can't really be cached and that the caching should be done at the model layer (i.e. cache the data coming from the database). I would certainly agree that caching the data layer is probably a good idea, but you shouldn't start by that. In fact without caching, this page renders fast enough. The problem is when someone like <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/">Roger Ebert</a> tweets about <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ebertchicago/status/85912164648497152">CinemaTreasures</a> the load on the app peaks significantly. At the point, the amount of concurrent connections your app can handle gets put to the challenge. Even though your page load is "fast enough", requests will queue up and some will eventually time out. That's actually a perfect case of HTTP caching.</p>

<p>What we want to do in that case is to cache a version of the home page in Varnish for 60 seconds. During that time, all requests coming to the site, will be served by Varnish and will all get the same cached content. That allows our servers to handle the non cached requests and therefore increase our throughput. What's even better, is that if a user refreshes the home page in his/her browser during the first 60 seconds the requests won't even make it all the way to our servers. All of that thanks to conditions set on the response. The first user hitting the HTTP cache layer (Varnish in this case) won't find a fresh cached response, so varnish will forward the request to our application layer which will send back the homepage to varnish and tell Varnish that this content is good for a full minute so please don't ask for it again until a minute from now. Varnish serves this response to the users' browser and let the browser know that the server said that the response was good enough for a minute so don't bother asking for it again. But now, if during these 60 seconds another user comes in, he will hit Varnish and Varnish will have the cached response from the first user and because the cache is still fresh (it's not been 60 seconds since the first request) and the cache is public, then the same response will be sent to the second user.</p>

<p>As you can see, the real strength of HTTP caching is the fact that it's a conditional caching. It's based on the request's URL and some "flags" set in the request/response headers.</p>

<p>Setting these conditions in your app is actually very simple since you just need to set the response's headers. If you are using a Ruby framework you will more than likely have access to the request object via the "request" method and you can set the headers directly like that: "response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=60'".
In Rails, you can actually use a helper method instead: expires_in 1.minute, :public => true.</p>

<p>You might have a case where you HAVE TO serve fresh content if available and can't serve stale cached content even for a few seconds. In this case, you can rely on the Etag header value. The Etag is meant to validate the freshness of a cached response. Think of it as a signature (unique ID) that is set on the response and used by the client (or cache layer) to see if the server response has changed or not. The way it works is that the client keeps track of the Etag received for each request (attached to the cached response) and then sends it with the next requests. The HTTP layer or application sees the Etag in the request and can check if it is still valid and the content didn't change. If that's the case, an empty response can be sent with a special HTTP status code (304) to let know the client that the old cached value is still good to be used.  Rails has a helper called "stale?" that helps you do the Etag/last modified check and allows you to not fetch all the objects from the database by doing a cheap check on an attribute (For instance you can check the updated_at value and use that as a condition to pull an object and its relationships).</p>

<p>So I explain HTTP caching, I often hear people telling me: "that's great Matt, but you know what, that won't work for us because we have custom content that we display specifically to our users". So in that case, you can always set the Cache-Control header to private which will only cache the response in the client's browser and not the cache layer. That's good to some extent, but it can definitely be improved by rethinking a bit your view layer. In most web apps, the page content is rendered by server side code (Rails, Django, node.js, PHP..) and sent to the user all prepared for him. There are a few challenges with this approach, the biggest one is that the server has to wait until everything is ready (all data fetched, view rendered etc...) before sending back a response and before the client's browser can start rendering (there are ways to chunk the response but that's besides the scope of this post). The other is that the same expensive content has to be calculated/rendered for two different users because you might be inserting the username of the current user at the top of the page for instance. A classic way to deal with that is often to use fragment caching, where the expensive rendering is cached and reused by different requests. That's good but if the only reason to do that is because we are displaying some user specific data, there is a simpler way: async page rendering. The concept is extremely simple: remove all user specific content from the rendered page and then inject the user content in a second step once the page is displayed. The advantage is that now the full page can be cached in Varnish (or Squid or whatever you use for HTTP caching). To inject the user content, the easiest way is to use JavaScript.</p>

<p>Let's stay on CinemaTreasures, when you're logged in, the username is shown on the top of each page:</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="574" caption="Once logged in, the username is displayed on all pages"]<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110710-mh5tqxuw1txf9kppn1smkkarrs.jpg" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>The only things that differs from the page rendered when the user is not logged in and when he is, are these 2 links and an avatar. So let's write some code to inject that after rendering the page.</p>

<p>In Rails, in the sessions controller or whatever code logs you in, you need to create a new cookie containing the username:</p>

<pre><code>cookies[:username] = {
         :value =&gt; session[:username],
         :expires =&gt; 2.days.from_now,
         :domain =&gt; ".cinematreasures.org"
       }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we don't store the data in the session cookie and the data won't be encrypted. You need to be careful that someone changing his cookie value can't access data he/should shouldn't. But that's a different discussion. Now that the cookie is set, we can read it from JavaScript when the page is loaded.</p>

<pre><code>document.observe("dom:loaded", function() {
  displayLoggedinUserLinks();
});

function readCookie(name) {
     var nameEQ = name + "=";
     var ca = document.cookie.split(';');
     for(var i=0;i &lt; ca.length;i++) {
          var c = ca[i];
          while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);
          if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);
     }
     return null;
}

function displayLoggedinUserLinks() {
  var username            = readCookie('username');
  var loginLink           = $('login');
  var logout              = $('logout');
  if (username == null){
    loginLink.show();
    logout.hide();
  }else{
    // user is logged in and we have his/her username
    loginLink.hide();
    if(userGreetings){ userGreetings.update("&lt;span id="username"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;"); }
    logout.show();
    showAvatar(username);
  };
  return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above doesn't do much, once the DOM is loaded, the displayLoggedinUserLinks() function gets trigger. This function reads the cookie via the readCookie() function and if a username is found, the login link is hidden, the user name is displayed, as well as the logout link and the avatar. (You can also use a jQuery cookie plugin to handle the cookie, but this is an old example using Prototype, replace the code accordingly)
When the user logs out, we just need to delete the username cookie and the cached page will be rendered properly. In Rails, you would do delete the cookie like that: cookies.delete('username').
Quite often you might even want to make an Ajax call to get some information such as the number of user messages or notifications. Using jQuery or whatever JS framework you fancy you can do that once the page is rendered. Here is an example, on this page, you can see the learderboards for MLB The Show. The leaderboards don't change that often, especially the overall leaderboards so they can be cached for a little while, however the player's presence can change anytime. The smart way to deal with that, would be to cache the  leaderboards for a few seconds/minutes and make an ajax call to a presence service passing it a list of user ids collected from the DOM. The service called via Ajax could also be cached  depending on the requirements.</p>

<p>Now there is one more problem that people using might encouter: flash notices. For those of you not familiar with Rails, flash notices are messages set in the controller and passed to the view via the session (at least last time I checked). The problem happens if I'm the home page isn't cached anymore and I logged in which redirects me to the home page with a flash message like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110710-1u6dn8rrc6r62rsg6niphhd2pi.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The problem is that the message is part of the rendered page and now for 60 seconds, all people hitting the home page will get the same message. This is why you would want to write a helper that would put this message in a custom cookie that you'd pull JS and then delete once displayed. You could use a helper like that to set the cookie:</p>

<pre><code>def flash_notice_cookie(msg, expiration=nil)
  cookies[:flash_notice] = {
    :value =&gt; msg,
    :expires =&gt; expiration || 1.minutes.from_now,
    :domain =&gt; ".cinematreasures.com"
   }
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then add a function called when the DOM is ready which loads the message and injects it in the DOM. Once the cookie read, delete it so the message isn't displayed again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So there you have it, if you follow these few steps, you should be able to handle easily 10x more traffic without increasing hardware or making any type of crazy code change. Before you start looking into memcached, redis, cdns or whatever, consider HTTP caching and async DOM manipulation. Finally, note that if you can't use Varnish or Squid, you can very easily setup <a href="http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/">Rack-Cache</a> locally and share the cache via memcached. It's also a great way to test locally.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update:</strong> CinemaTreasures was updated to use HTTP caching as described above. The hosting cost is now half of what it used to be and the throughput is actually higher which offers a better protection against peak traffic.</p>

    <link href="http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2011/04/14/video-game-web-framework-design/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-14T10:28:39+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2011/04/14/video-game-web-framework-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will do my best to explain why and how I reinvented the wheel and wrote a custom web framework for some of Sony's <a href="http://www.gameproducer.net/2006/05/26/what-are-aaa-titles/">AAA console titles</a>. My goal is to reflect on my work by walking you through the design process and some of the implementation decisions. This is not about being right or being wrong, it's about designing a technical solution to solve concrete business challenges.</p>

<h2>Problem Domain</h2>

<p>The video game industry is quite special, to say the least. It shares a lot of similarities with the movie industry. The big difference is that  the movie industry hasn't evolved as quickly as the video game  industry has. But the concept is the same, someone comes up with a great  idea, finds a team/studio to develop the game and finds a publisher. The  development length and budget depends on the type of game, but for a AAA  console game, it usually takes a least a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/09/god-of-war-3-has-44-million-dollar-budget/">few million</a> and a minimum of a year of work once the project has received the green light. The creation of such a game involves various teams, designers, artists, animators, audio teams, developers, producers, QA, marketing, management/overhead etc.. Once the game gets released, players purchase the whole game for a one time fee and the studio moves  on to their next game. Of course things are not that simple, with the latest platforms, we now have the option to patch games, add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">DLC</a> etc.. But historically, a console game is considered done when it ships, exactly like a movie, and very little work is scheduled post release.</p>

<p>Concretely such an approach exposes a few challenges when trying to implement online features for a <a href="http://www.gameproducer.net/2006/05/26/what-are-aaa-titles/">AAA console title</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Communication with the game client network team</p></li>
<li><p>Scalability, performance</p></li>
<li><p>Insane deadlines, unstable design (constant change of requirements)</p></li>
<li><p>Can't afford to keep on working on the system once released (time delimited projects)</p></li>
</ul>


<p> </p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>As in most situations, communication is one of the biggest challenges. Communication is even harder in the video game industry since you have so many teams and experts involved. Each team speaks its own jargon, has its own expertise and its own deadlines. But all focus on the same goal: releasing the best game ever. The team I'm part of has implementing online features as its goal. That's the way we bring business value to our titles. Concretely, that means that we provide the game client developers with a C++ SDK which connects to custom web APIs written in Ruby. The API implementations rely on various data stores (<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>, <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>, memory) to store and retrieve all sorts of game data.</p>

<p>Nobody but our team should care about the implementation details, after all, the whole point of providing an API is to provide a simple interface so others can do their part of the job in the easiest way possible. This is exactly where communication becomes a problem. The design of these APIs should be the result of the work of two teams with two different domains of expertise and different concerns. One team focuses on client performance, memory optimization and making the online resources available to the game engine without affecting the game play. The other, focuses on server performance, latency, scalability, data storage and system contention under load. Both groups have to come together to find a compromise making each other's job doable. Unfortunately, things are not that simple and game designers (who are usually not technical people) have a hard time <em>not</em> changing their designs and requirements every other week (usually for good reasons) making API design challenging and creating tension between the teams.</p>

<p>From this perspective, the API is the most important deliverable for our team and it should communicate the design goal while being very explicit about how it works, why it works the way it does, and how to implement it client side. This is a very good place where we can improve communication by making sure that we focus on making clear, well designed, well documented, flexible APIs.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Scalability, performance</h2>

<p>On the server side, the APIs need to perform and scale to handles tends of thousands of concurrent requests. Web developers often rely on aggressive <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html">HTTP caching</a> but in our case, the web client (our SDK) has a limited amount of memory available and 90% of the requests are user specific (can't use full page HTTP cache) and a lot of these are POST/DELETE requests (can't be cached). That means that, to scale, we have to focus on what most developers don't often have to worry too much about: all the small details which, put together with a high load, end up drastically affecting your performance.</p>

<p>While Ruby is a great language, a lot of the libraries and frameworks are not optimized for performance, at least not the type of performance needed for our use case. However, the good news is that this is easily fixable and many alternatives exist (lots of async, non-blocking drivers for i.e). When obsessed with performance, you quickly learn to properly load test, profile, and monitor your code to find the bottlenecks and the places where you should focus your attention. The big, unique challenge though, is that a console game will more than likely see its peak traffic in the first few weeks, not really giving the chance to the online team to iteratively handle the prod issues. The only solution is to do everything possible before going live to ensure that the system will perform as expected. Of course if we were to write the same services in a more performant language, we would need to spend less time optimizing. But we are gaining so much flexibility by using a higher level programming language that, in my mind, the trade off is totally worth it (plus you still need to spend a lot of time optimizing your code path, even if your code is written in a very fast language).</p>

<h2>Deadlines, requirement changes</h2>

<p>That's just part of the way the industry works. Unless you work for <a href="http://blizzard.com">Blizzard</a> and you can afford to spend a crazy amount of time and money on the development of a title; you will have to deal with sliding deadlines, requirement changes, scope changes etc... The only way I know how to protect myself from such things is to plan for the worst. Being a non-idealistic (read pessimistic) person helps a lot. When you design your software, make sure your design is sound but flexible enough to handle any major change that you know could happen at any time. Pick your battles and make sure your assumptions are properly thought through, communicated and documented so others understand and accept them. In a nutshell, this is a problem we can't avoid, so you need to embrace it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Limited reusability</h2>

<p>This topic has a lot to do with the previous paragraph. Because scopes can change often and because the deadlines are often crazy, a lot of the time, engineers don't take the time to think about reusability. They slap some code together, pray to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Kobol">lords of Kobol</a> and hope that they won't have to look at their code ever again (I'm guilty of having done that too). The result is a lot of throw away code. This is actually quite frequent and normal in our industry. But it doesn't mean that it the right thing to do! The assumption/myth is that each game is different and therefore two games can't be using the same tech solution. My take on that is that it's partly true. But some components are the same for 80% of the games I work on. So why not design them well and reuse the common parts? (A lot of games share the same engines, such as <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal</a> for example, and there is no reason why we can't build a core online engine extended for each title)</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>My approach</h2>

<p>When I joined Sony, I had limited experience with the console video game industry and my experience was not even related to online gaming. So even though I had (strong) opinions (and was often quite (perhaps even too) vocal about them), I did my best to improve existing components and work with the existing system. During that time, the team shipped 4 AAA titles on the existing system. As we were going through the game cycles, I did my best to understand the problem domain, the reasons behind some of the design decisions and finally I looked at what could be done differently to improve our business value. After releasing a title with some serious technical difficulties, I spent some time analyzing and listing the problems we had and their root causes. I asked our senior director for a mission statement and we got the team together to define the desiderata/objectives of our base technology. Here is what we came up with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stability</p></li>
<li><p>Performance / Scalability</p></li>
<li><p>Encapsulation / Modularity</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Conventions</p></li>
<li><p>Reusability / Maintainability</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These objectives are meant to help us objectively evaluate two options. The legacy solution was based on Rails, or more accurately: Rails was used in the legacy solution. Rails had been hacked in so many different ways that it was really hard to update anything without breaking random parts of the framework. The way to do basic things kept being changed, there was no consistent design, no entry points, no conventions and each new game would duplicate the source code of the previously released game and make the game specific changes. Patches were hard to back port and older titles were often not patched up. The performance was atrocious under load, mainly due to hacked-up Rails not performing well. (Rails was allocating so many objects per request that the GC was taking a huge amount of the request cycles, the default XML builder also created a ton load of objects etc...) This was your typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows scenario</a>. Engineers were getting frustrated, motivation was fainting, bugs were piling up and nobody felt ownership over the tech.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, it is important to explain that the legacy system was hacked up together due to lack of time, lack of resources and a lot of pressure to release something ASAP. So, while the end result sounds bad, the context is very important to note. This is quite common in software engineering and when you get there, the goal is not to point fingers but to identify the good and the bad parts of the original solution. You then use this info to decide what to do: fix the existing system or rewrite, porting the good parts.</p>

<p>Our report also came up with a plan. A plan to redesign our technology stack to match the desiderata previously mentioned. To put it simply, the plan was to write a new custom web framework focusing on stability, performance, modularity and documentation. Now, there are frameworks out there which already do that or value these principles. But none of them focus on web APIs and none of them are specific to game development. Finally, the other issue was that we had invested a lot of time on game specific code and we couldn't throw away all that work, so the new framework had to support a good chunk of legacy code but had to make it run much faster.</p>

<h2>Design choices</h2>

<p><strong>Low conversion cost</strong></p>

<p>Using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> &amp; <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffee script</a>/<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>/<a href="http://weblocks.viridian-project.de/">whatever</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8cgi/">new</a> <a href="https://github.com/tenderlove/phuby">fancy tech</a> was not really an option. We have a bunch of games out there which are running on the old system and some of these games will have a sequel or a game close enough that we could reuse part of the work. We don't want to have to rewrite the existing code. I therefore made sure that we could reuse 90% of the business logic by adding an abstraction layer doing the heavy lifting at boot time and therefore not affecting the runtime performance. Simple conversion scripts were also written to import the core of the existing code over.</p>

<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> It is very tempting to just redo everything and start from scratch. However, the business logic implementation wasn't the main cause of our problems. Even though I wish we could have redesigned that piece of the puzzle, it didn't make sense from a business perspective. A lot of thought had to be put into how to obtain the expected performance level while keeping the optional model/controller/view combos. By having full control of the "web engine", we managed to isolate things properly without breaking the old paradigms. We also got rid of a lot of assumptions allowing us to design new titles a bit differently while being backward compatible and have our code run dramatically faster.</p>

<p><strong>Web API centric</strong></p>

<p>This is probably the most important design element. If I had to summarize what our system does in just a few words, I would say: a game web API. Of course, it's much more than that. We have admin interfaces, producer dashboards, community websites, lobbies, p2p, BI reports, async processing jobs etc... But at the end of the day, the only one piece you can't remove is the game web API. So I really wanted the design to focus on that aspect. When a developer starts implementing a new online game feature, I want him/her to think about the API. But I also want this API to be extremely well documented so the developer working client-side understands the purpose of the API, how to use it, and what the expected response is right away. I also wanted to be able to automatically test our APIs at a very basic level so we could validate that there are discrepancies between what the client expects and what the server provides. To do that, I created a standalone API DSL with everything needed to describe your API but without any implementation details whatsoever. The API DSL lets the developer define a route (url), the HTTP verb expected, if the request should be authenticated or not, SSL or not, the param rules, default values and finally a response description (which was quite a controversial choice). All of these settings can be documented by the developer. This standalone DSL can then be consumed by different tools. For instance we have a tool extracting all the info into nicely formatted HTML doc for the game client developers. This tool doesn't need to load the framework to just render the documentation. We also use this description at boot time to compile the validation rules and routes, allowing for a much faster request dispatch. And we also use these API description to generate some low level data for the client. Finally, we used the service description DSL to help create mocked service responses allowing the client team to test service designs without having to wait for the implementation streamlining the process.</p>

<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> We had a lot of internal discussions about the need to define the response within the service description. Some argued that it's a duplication since we already had a view and we could parse that to get most of what we needed (which is what the old system was doing). We ended up going with the response description DSL for a few critical reasons: testing and implementation simplicity. <em>Testing:</em> we need to have an API expectation reference and to keep this reference sane so we can see if something is changed. If we were to magically parse the response, we couldn't test the view part of the code against a frame of reference. <em>Implementation simplicity</em>: magically parsing a view template is more tricky that it sounds, you would need to render the template with the right data to make it work properly. Furthermore, you can't document a response easily in the view, and if you do, you arguably break the separation of concern between the description and the implementation. Finally, generated documentation isn't enough and that's why we decided to write English documentation, some being close to the code and some being just good old documentation explaining things outside of the code context.</p>

<p><strong>Modularity</strong></p>

<p>In order to make our code reusable we had to isolate each component and limit the dependencies. We wrote a very simple extension layer allowing each extension to registers itself once detected. The extension interface exposes the path of the extension, its type, models, services, controllers, migrations, seed data, dependencies etc.. Each extension is contained in a folder. (The extension location doesn't matter much but as part of the framework boot sequence, we check a few default places.) The second step of the process is to check a manifest/config file that is specific to each title. The manifest file lists the extensions that should be activated for the title. The framework then activates the marked extensions and has access to libs, models, views, migrations, seed data and of course to load services (DSL mentioned earlier) etc...</p>

<p>Even though we designed the core extensions the best we could, there are cases where some titles will need to extend these extensions. To do that, we added a bunch of hooks that could be implemented on the title side if needed (Ruby makes that super easy and clean to do!). A good example of that is the login sequence or the player data.</p>

<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> The challenge with modularity is to keep things simple and highly performing yet flexible. A key element to manage that is to stay as consistent as possible. Don't implement hooks three different ways, try to keep method signatures consistent, keep it simple and organized.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It's a bit early to say if this rewrite is a success or not and there are still lots of optimizations and technology improvements we are looking forward to doing. Only time will give us enough retrospect to evaluate our work. But because we defined the business value (mission statement) and the technical objectives, it is safe to say that the new framework meets the expectations quite well. On an early benchmark we noted a 10X speed improvement and that's before drilling into the performance optimizations such as making all the calls non-blocking, using better connection pools, cache write through layer... However, there is still one thing that we will have to monitor: how much business value will this framework generate. And I guess that's where we failed to define an agreed upon evaluation grid. I presume that if our developers spend more time designing and implementing APIs and less time debugging that could be considered business value. If we spend less time maintaining or fighting with the game engine, that would also be a win. Finally, if the player experience is improved we will be able to definitely say that we made the right choice.</p>

<p>To conclude, I'd like to highlight my main short coming: I failed to define metrics that would help us evaluate the real business value added to our products. What I consider a technical success might not be a business success. How do you, in your own domain, find ways to define clear and objective metrics?</p>

    <updated>2011-02-22T22:34:30+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2011/02/22/concurrency-in-ruby-explained</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Concurrency is certainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_Net">not a new problem</a> but it's getting more and more attention as machines start having more than 1 core, that web traffic increases drastically and that some new technologies show up saying that they are better because they handle concurrency better.
If that helps, think of concurrency as multitasking. When people say that they want concurrency, they say that they want their code to do multiple different things at the same time. When you are on your computer, you don't expect to have to choose between browsing the web and listening to some music. You more than likely want to run both concurrently. It's the same thing with your code, if you are running a webserver, you probably don't want it to only process one request at a time.
The aim of this article is to explain as simply as possible the concept of concurrency in Ruby, the reason why it's a complicated topic and finally the different solutions to achieve concurrency.</p>

<p>First off, if you are not really familiar with concurrency, take a minute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29">read the wikipedia article on the topic</a> which is a great recap on the subject. But now, you should have noticed that my above example was more about parallel programming than concurrency, but we'll come back to that in a minute.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The real question at the heart of the quest for concurrency is: "how to increase code throughput".</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>We want our code to perform better, and we want it to do more in less time. Let's take two simple and concrete examples to illustrate concurrency. First, let's pretend you are writing a twitter client, you probably want to let the user scroll his/her tweets while the latest updates are  being fetched. In other words, you don't want to block the main loop and interrupt the user interaction while your code is waiting for a response from the Twitter API. To do that, a common solution is to use multiple <strong>threads</strong>. Threads are basically processes that run in the same memory context. We would be using one thread for the main event loop and another thread to process the remote API request. Both threads share the same memory context so once the Twitter API thread is done fetching the data it can update the display. Thankfully, this is usually transparently handled by asynchronous APIs (provided by the OS or the programming language std lib) which avoid blocking the main thread.</p>

<p>The second example is a webserver. Let's say you want to run a Rails application. Because you are awesome, you expect to see a lot of traffic. Probably more than 1 QPS (query/request per second). You benchmarked your application and you know that the average response time is approximately 100ms. Your Rails app can therefore handle 10QPS using a single process (you can do 10 queries at 100ms in a second).</p>

<p>But what happens if your application gets more than 10 requests per second? Well, it's simple, the requests will be backed up and will take longer until some start timing out. This is why you want to improve your concurrency. There are different ways to do that, a lot of people feel really strong about these different solutions but they often forget to explain why they dislike one solution or prefer one over the other. You might have heard people conclusions which are often one of these: <a href="http://canrailsscale.com/">Rails can't scale</a>, you only get concurrency with <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2009/8/13/threads_suck/">threads suck</a>, the only way to concurrency is via threads, we should switch to <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>/<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>/<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, use<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/fibers-eventmachine-rack-performance-gains-3395.html"> fibers</a> and you will be fine, add more machines, <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/unicorn-is-unix">forking > threading</a>.  Depending on who said what and how often you heard it on twitter, conferences, blog posts, you might start believing what others are saying. But do you really understand why people are saying that and are you sure they are right?</p>

<p>The truth is that this is a complicated matter. The good news is that it's not <em>THAT</em> complicated!</p>

<p>The thing to keep in mind is that the concurrency models are often defined by the programming language you use. In the case of Java, <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/index.html">threading is the usual solution</a>, if you want your Java app to be more concurrent, just run every single request in its own thread and you will be fine (kinda). In PHP, you simply don't have threads, instead you will start a new process per request. Both have pros and cons, the advantage of the Java threaded approach is that the memory is shared between the threads so you are saving in memory (and startup time), each thread can easily talk to each other via the shared memory. The advantage of PHP is that you don't have to worry about locks, deadlocks, threadsafe code and all that mess hidden behind threads. Described like that it looks pretty simple, but you might wonder why PHP doesn't have threads and why Java developers don't prefer starting multiple processes. The answer is probably related to the language design decisions. PHP is a language designed for the web and for short lived processes. PHP code should be fast to load and not use too much memory. Java code is slower to boot and to warm up, it usually uses quite a lot of memory. Finally, Java is a general purpose programming language not designed primarily for the internet. Others programming languages like <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> use a third approach: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the actor model</a>. The actor model is somewhat a bit of a mix of both solutions, the difference is that actors are a like threads which don't share the same memory context. Communication between actors is done via exchanged messages ensuring that each actor handles its own state and therefore avoiding corrupt data (two threads can modify the same data at the same time, but an actor can't receive two messages at the exact same time). We'll talk about that design pattern later on, so don't worry if you are confused.</p>

<p>What about Ruby? Should Ruby developers use threads, multiple processes, actors, something else? The answer is: <strong>yes</strong>!</p>

<h2>Threads</h2>

<p>Since version 1.9, Ruby has native threads (before that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a> were used). So in theory, if we would like to, we should be able to use threads everywhere like most Java developers do. Well, that's almost true, the problem is that Ruby, like Python uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (aka GIL). This GIL is a locking mechanism that is meant to protect your data integrity. The GIL only allows data to be modified by one thread at time and therefore doesn't let threads corrupt data but also it doesn't allow them to truly run concurrently. That is why some people say that Ruby and Python are not capable of (true) concurrency.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110223-kk58iq5yjdpmyswf7nuya4c4kp.jpg" alt="Global Interpreter Lock by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>However these people often don't mention that the GIL makes single threaded programs faster, that multi-threaded programs are much easier to develop since the data structures are safe and finally that a lot of C extensions are not thread safe and without the GIL, these C extensions don't behave properly. These arguments don't convince everyone and that's why you will hear some people say you should look at another Ruby implementation without a GIL, such as <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> (hydra branch) or <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> (Rubinius &amp; MacRuby also offer other concurrency approaches). If you are using an implementation without a GIL, then using threads in Ruby has exactly the same pros/cons than doing so in Java. However, it means that now you have to deal with the nightmare of threads: making sure your data is safe, doesn't deadlock, check that your code, your libs, plugins and gems are thread safe. Also, running too many threads might affect the performance because your OS doesn't have enough resources to allocate and it ends up spending its time context switching. It's up to you to see if it's worth it for your project.</p>

<h2>Multiple processes &amp; forking</h2>

<p>That's the most commonly used solution to gain concurrency when using Ruby and Python. Because the default language implementation isn't capable of true concurrency or because you want to avoid the challenges of thread programming, you might want to just start more processes. That's really easy as long as you don't want to share states between running processes. If you wanted to do so, you would need to use <a href="http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/drb/introduction.html">DRb</a>, a message bus like <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, or a shared data store like memcached or a DB. The caveat is that you now need to use a LOT more memory. If want to run 5 Rails processes and your app uses 100Mb you will now need 500Mb, ouch that's a lot of memory! That is exactly what happens when you use a Rails webserver like Mongrel. Now some other servers like <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> and <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a> found a workaround, they rely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28operating_system%29">unix forking</a>. The advantage of forking in an unix environment implementing the copy-on-write semantics is that we create a new copy of the main process but they both "share" the same physical memory. However, each process can modify its own memory without affecting the other processes. So now, Passenger can load your 100Mb Rails app in a process, then fork this process 5 times and the total footprint will be just a bit more than 100Mb and you can now handle 5X more concurrent requests. Note that if you are allocating memory in your request processing code (read controller/view) your overall memory will grow but you can still run many more processes before running out of memory. This approach is appealing because really easy and pretty safe. If a forked process acts up or leaks memory, just destroy it and create a new fork from the master process. Note that this approach is also used in <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a>, the async job processing solution by <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This solution works well if you want to duplicate a full process like a webserver, however it gets less interesting when you just want to execute some code "in the background". Resque took this approach because by nature async jobs can yield weird results, leak memory or hang. Dealing with forks allows for an external control of the processes and the cost of the fork isn't a big deal since we are already in an async processing approach.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/cogit8-org/img/hardcore-forking-action.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Actors/Fibers</h2>

<p>Earlier we talked a bit about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a>. Since Ruby 1.9, developers now have access to a new type of "lightweight" threads called <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/Fiber.html">Fibers</a>. Fibers are not actors and Ruby doesn't have a native Actor model implementation but some people wrote <a href="http://doc.revactor.org/files/README.html">some actor libs</a> on top of fibers. A fiber is like a simplified thread which isn't scheduled by the VM but by the programmer. Fibers are like blocks which can be paused and resumed from the outside of from within themselves. Fibers are faster and use less memory than threads as demonstrated in <a href="http://oldmoe.blogspot.com/2008/08/ruby-fibers-vs-ruby-threads.html">this blog post</a>. However, because of the GIL, you still cannot truly run more than one concurrent fiber by thread and if you want to use multiple CPU cores, you will need to run fibers within more than one thread. So how do fibers help with concurrency? The answer is that they are part of a bigger solution. Fiber allow developers to manually control the scheduling of "concurrent" code but also to have the code within the fiber to auto schedule itself. That's pretty big because now you can wrap an incoming web request in its own fiber and tell it to send a response back when it's done doing its things. In the meantime, you can move on the to next incoming request. Whenever a request within a fiber is done, it will automatically resume itself and be returned. Sounds great right? Well, the only problem is that if you are doing any type of blocking IO in a fiber, the entire thread is blocked and the other fibers aren't running. Blocking operations are operations like database/memcached queries, http requests... basically things you are probably triggering from your controllers. The good news is that the "only" problem to fix now is to avoid blocking IOs. Let's see how to do that.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110223-8wkfs2g12p15ku18rm7aq9negf.jpg" alt="fiber" /></p>

<h2>Non blocking IOs/Reactor pattern.</h2>

<p>The reactor pattern is quite simple to understand really. The heavy work of making blocking IO calls is delegated to an external service (reactor) which can receive concurrent requests. The service handler (reactor) is given callback methods to trigger asynchronously based on the type of response received. Let me take a limited analogy to hopefully explain the design better. It's a bit like if you were asking someone a hard question, the person will take a while to reply but his/her reply will make you decide if you raise a flag or not. You have two options, or you choose to wait for the response and decide to raise the flag based on the response, or your flag logic is already defined and you tell the person what to do based on their answer and move on without having to worry about waiting for the answer. The second approach is exactly what the reactor pattern is. It's obviously slightly more complicated but the key concept is that it allows your code to define methods/blocks to be called based on the response which will come later on.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110223-xkit6utnty1sdt84n15w7dgtnh.jpg" alt="Reactor from Matt Aimonetti's blog" /></p>

<p>In the case of a single threaded webserver that's quite important. When a request comes in and your code makes a DB query, you are blocking any other requests from being processed. To avoid that, we could wrap our request in a fiber, trigger an async DB call and pause the fiber so another request can get processed as we are waiting for the DB. Once the DB query comes back, it wakes up the fiber it was trigger from, which then sends the response back to the client. Technically, the server can still only send one response at a time, but now fibers can run in parallel and don't block the main tread by doing blocking IOs (since it's done by the reactor).</p>

<p>This is the approach used by <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>, <a href="http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Deferrable.html">EventMachine</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Ruby developers can use EventMachine or an EventMachine based webserver like <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony">EM clients/drivers</a> to make non blocking async calls. Mix that with some Fiber love and you get Ruby concurrency. Be careful though, using Thin, non blocking drivers and Rails in threadsafe mode doesn't mean you are doing concurrent requests. Thin/EM only use one thread and you need to let it know that it's ok to handle the next request as we are waiting. This is done by <a href="http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Deferrable.html">deferring the response</a> and let the reactor know about it.</p>

<p>The obvious problem with this approach is that it forces you to change the way you write code. You now need to set a bunch of callbacks, understand the Fiber syntax, and use deferrable responses, I have to admit that this is kind of a pain. If you look at some Node.js code, you will see that it's not always an <a href="http://howtonode.org/control-flow-part-ii/file-write.js">elegant approach</a>. The good news tho, is that this process can be wrapped and your code can be written as it if was processed synchronously while being handled asynchronously under the covers. This is a bit more complex to explain without showing code, so this will be the topic of a future post. But I do believe that things will get much easier soon enough.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>High concurrency with Ruby is doable and done by many. However, it could made easier. Ruby 1.9 gave us fibers which allow for a more granular control over the concurrency scheduling, combined with non-blocking IO, high concurrency can be achieved. There is also the easy solution of forking a running process to multiply the processing power. However the real question behind this heated debate is what is the future of the Global Interpreter Lock in Ruby, should we remove it to improve concurrency at the cost of dealing with some new major threading issues, unsafe C extensions, etc..? Alternative Ruby implementers seem to believe so, but at the same time Rails still ships with a default mutex lock only allowing requests to be processed one at a time, the reason given being that a lot of people using Rails don't write thread safe code and a lot of plugins are not threadsafe. Is the future of concurrency something more like <a href="http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/">libdispatch</a>/<a href="http://www.macruby.org/documentation/gcd.html">GCD</a> where the threads are handled by the kernel and the developer only deals with a simpler/safer API?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Designing beautiful and scalable software is hard. Really hard.</p>

<p>It's hard for many reasons. But what makes it even harder is that software scalability is a relatively new challenge, something only really done in big companies, companies that are not really keen on sharing their knowledge. The amount of academic work done on software design is quite limited compared to other types of design, but shared knowledge about scalable design is almost nonexistent <em>(Don't expect to find detailed information about scaling online video games either, the industry is super secretive. And even if this is a niche market where finding skilled/experienced developers is really challenging, information is not shared outside a game project).</em></p>

<p>I don't pretend to have the required knowledge to cover this topic at length. However, I do have some exposure and figured I should share what I learned so others can benefit from my experience and push the discussion further.</p>

<p>Designing scalable software is just like any other type of software design, with a few unique constraints. If I had to define the key requirements of a great design I would have to quote Frederick P. Brooks:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Great designs have conceptual integrity - unity, economy, clarity"</p></blockquote>

<p>This is true for any type of design and one should always start by that.
Don't just jump on your keyboard and start writing tests/code right away. Take a minute to think about your design.
That will save you hours of refactoring and headaches.</p>

<h2>You're a designer and might not even know it</h2>

<p>You might not be designing the next NASA engine but you are more than likely designing an API that you and others will use. As a matter of fact, unless you write code that will never be seen again, you are writing an Application Programming Interface (API). Every single class, method, function you write is an API that you and others will use. Remember that every time you write code, you are the implementer of a design, and therefore you are a designer.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_916" align="alignright" width="150" caption="Giana and I, discussing design patterns"]<a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/31/designing-for-scalability/giana_and_moi_lowres/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/giana_and_moi_lowres-150x150.jpg" alt="Giana and Matt Aimonetti" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>When thinking about your design, focus on design concepts instead of implementation details. A design concept must be clear, simple to both explain with words and draw on a whiteboard. If you can't draw and explain your design on a whiteboard, you have failed one of the great design requirement: clarity. If you work alone, or your coworkers are tired of hearing you, try rubber ducking your design ideas. It's the same concept as rubber ducking debugging, where a programmer would force himself to explain his code, line-by-line, to a rubber duck on his desk but instead of talking about the code, explain your design and why it's awesome (I've recently done this with my baby girl and it's been really helpful).</p>

<h2>Keeping the design integrity</h2>

<p>One of the challenges of designing scalable software is that your constraints are often very unique to your product. Off the shelf solutions don't work for you, and the specific solution used by another project can't be transposed to your project because the cause and the effect of what you need to scale are different. The problem is that you really quickly lose design integrity.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at a concrete example to see how the design integrity can be lost or even not defined at all.
Let's pretend we want to write a suite of web APIs for video games.</p>

<p>We can look at this task from different perspectives:<a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/31/designing-for-scalability/the-shout-2/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/the-shout1-150x150.jpg" alt="the shout posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Video game deadlines are crazy, let's find a way to release as many APIs ASAP.</p></li>
<li><p>We're going to get a huge amount of traffic, let's make sure we don't crash and burn.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to make sure our APIs are simple to use for the dev teams integrating them.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these perspectives reflects a facet of the challenge. Other facets exist that I didn't mention but that a business person might have listed right away, one of which being: How can we do that for the least amount of money?</p>

<p>To design our API suite, we first need to understand the different perspectives. Gaining this understanding will help us design something better but it will also help us communicate better with the different stakeholders. Once we have a decent understanding of the constraints and expectations, someone needs to explicitly define the design values and their priorities. This is a crucial step in the design process. Systems nowadays are too complicated to be handled by only one person and keeping design integrity requires clear communication.</p>

<h2>Design goal and values</h2>

<p>The best way to communicate the design is to write a simple sentence defining the primary goal:
"Build a robust, efficient and flexible middleware solution leveraged by external teams to develop online video game features."</p>

<p>This is a bit like the mission statement of your project, or the elevator pitch you give someone that asks you what you are working on.</p>

<p>Associated with the primary goal are a host of desiderata, or secondary objectives. These are the key objectives used to weigh technical decisions. It's important for the design to highlight a scale of values so one can refer to them to decide if his/her idea fits the design or not. Here is an example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stability</p></li>
<li><p>Performance / Scalability</p></li>
<li><p>Encapsulation / Modularity</p></li>
<li><p>Conventions</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Reusability / Maintainability</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Often these desiderata are applied to most of your projects and reflect your team/company's technical values. The list might seem simple and unnecessary but, believe me, it will reduce the arguments where John tells Jane that her idea sucks but his is better because he "knows better". Having an objective reference to refer to when trying to decide which is the best way to go is greatly valuable and will reduce the amount of office drama.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>Finally, make sure to explicitly define all the major constraints and to acknowledge the team's concerns. Here is a small example of what could be listed (which also reflect the previously mentioned perspectives):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>hard deadlines</p></li>
<li><p>external teams involved</p></li>
<li><p>huge load expected</p></li>
<li><p>limited support available</p></li>
<li><p>requirements changing quickly</p></li>
<li><p>limited budget</p></li>
<li><p>unknown hosting architecture/constraints</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that design is always iterative because the constraints keep changing. That's just the way it is and a lot of technical constraints only appear as you implement or test your design. That's also why the design needs to be clear but the implementation needs to be flexible.</p>

<h2>Reads vs writes</h2>

<p>Most of the web apps out there are read heavy, meaning that the stored data gets more accessed than modified. Scaling these type of systems is easier as one can introduce a cache layer, an intermediary storage, which acts as a fast buffer that avoids putting load on the backends. The cost reduction is huge because if you architected your app properly, the data is read from the data store only once (or once every X minutes) after being created/modified.</p>

<p>Caching is so important that it's even built into the HTTP protocol, making caching trivial.
Speaking of HTTP, a common problem I often see when serving http content to a browser is that even though the backend calls are the same, some information needs to be customized for the current visitor. This prevents it from caching the entire page. An easy solution in this case is to still cache the entire page but to use javascript to fetch the custom data from the backend and to modify the cached http at the client's browser level directly. As part of your design, you will more than likely need to implement multiple layers of caching and use technologies such as query caching, Varnish, Squid, Memcached, memoization, etc...</p>

<p>The problem is that, as your system gets more traffic, you will notice that the volume of DB/network writes becomes your bottleneck. You will also notice a reduction of your cache/hit ratio because only a small part of your cached data is often retrieved by many clients. At this point, you will need to denormalize to avoid contention, shard your data in silos, or write to cache and flush from cache when the data store is available and not overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous processing</h2>

<p>One way to avoid write contention is to use async processing. The concept is simple. Instead of directly writing to your datastore after your backend receives a request, you put a message in a queue with all the information needed to run the operation later. On the other side, you have a set number of workers receiving messages and operating on them one after the other.</p>

<p>The advantage of such an approach is that you control the amount of workers and therefore the amount of maximum concurrent writes to your datastore. You can also process the queue before it gets worked and and maybe coalesce some messages or remove outdated/duplicated message. Finally, you can assign more workers to some message types, making sure the important messages get processed first.</p>

<p>Another advantage of this design includes not letting the client hang while you're processing the data and potentially timeout. You can also process a long queue faster by starting more workers to catch up and retire them later.
You app is more resilient to errors and failed async jobs can be restarted.</p>

<h2>Load test, monitor and be proactive</h2>

<p>Even the best designs have weak spots and will have to be improved once they are released. Don't wait for your system to fall apart before looking for solutions. Monitor your app. Every single part of your app. Look for patterns showing signs of potential problems and imagine what you could do to resolve them if they would start manifesting.</p>

<p>Of course before getting there, you will need to understand each part of your system and benchmark/load test/profile your app so you can be ready to face the storm.</p>

<p>Benchmarks and load tests are both super important and, too often, not reflective of what you will really face later on. They are usually great at identifying major problems that should be resolved right away, but fail to show the one big problem you will see on day one when you have to deal with 20k concurrent requests. Use them as indicators, rely on your experience and learn about problems other have faced. This will help you build a knowledge of scalability challenges, their root causes, and their potential solutions.</p>

<p>For benchmarking Ruby code, I use the<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/classes/Benchmark.html"> built-in benchmark tool available in the standard lib</a>.
For simple load testing, I use <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a>/<a href="http://www.xenoclast.org/autobench/">autobench</a> and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/siege/">siege</a>.
For anything more complicated, I use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a>.
In the video game industry, we also often use sims using the client's code to create load.</p>

<p>Benchmarking without profiling is often useless. Unlike other programming languages, Ruby doesn't yet have awesome profiling tools easy to use, but things are evolving quickly. Here are some tools I use regularly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb">Ruby wrapper</a> around <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/">google perftools</a> is really good.
Before using perftools as often as I do now, I frequently used <a href="http://ruby-prof.rubyforge.org/">ruby-prof</a> with <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html">kcachegrind</a>.
Ruby 1.9 lets you inspect its garbage collector as explained in a <a href="http://merbist.com/2010/07/29/object-allocation-why-you-should-care/">previous post</a>.
And when using <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a>, I often use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a>.</p>

<h2>Other misc. things I learned</h2>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Documentation is critical. It doesn't matter how you do it but you need to make sure you document what you want to build, how you build it, and why you build it. Documenting will help you and the others working on the project, and will keep you in check. I have started documenting an API and then realized that the design was flawed. Maybe it's just the way you name a method, or a class, or it can be a weird method signature or even the entire workflow being wrong, but when you document things, design errors appear more obviously.</p>

<p>To document Ruby code, I use <a href="http://yardoc.org/">yard</a> which is quite similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">javadoc</a>. Code documentation, when writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck typed language</a>, is, for me, very important since it makes the API designer's expectations much clearer. I also often add English documentation, written in markdown files and compiled by yard. If you say that your code is simple and that it doesn't require documentation because anyone can just read it and understand ... then you have totally miss the point. Yes, it's more work to keep documentation and code in sync. But people using web APIs don't have access to the implementation details. The people distributing compiled APIs don't give access to their implementation. And honestly, the API should be decoupled from the implementation. I shouldn't have to guess how to use your API based on how you implemented the code underneath, otherwise my assumptions might be totally wrong.</p>

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility. The law of system entropy says that systems become more disorganized over time, so don't start with complicated code if you can avoid it! It's not because your programming language lets you do crazy stuff that you have to use it. In 90+% of the time, your code can be written without voodoo and be easier to read, easier to understand, easier to maintain and faster to execute.</p>

<p>If you can't figure out how to <strong><em>not</em></strong> use metaprogramming or weird patterns, take a step back and look at your design, did you miss something?
Also, don't reinvent the wheel. Use the language the way it was designed to be used. Keep your APIs as small as possible, don't expose too much as it will be virtually impossible to remove it later on.</p>

<p>As an example, look to what extent Rails modified the Ruby language:</p>

<p>In Rails' console (Rails 2, Ruby 1.8.7)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Array.ancestors
=&gt; [Array, ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::RandomAccess,
 ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::Grouping, ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::ExtractOptions,
 ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::Conversions, ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Array::Access,
 Enumerable, Object, ERB::Util, ActiveSupport::Dependencies::Loadable, Base64::Deprecated, Base64,
 Kernel]
&gt;&gt; [].methods.size
=&gt; 233
</code></pre>

<p>In irb:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Array.ancestors
=&gt; [Array, Enumerable, Object, Kernel]
&gt;&gt; [].methods.size
=&gt; 149
</code></pre>

<p>Removing any of these added methods is virtually impossible since some piece of code somewhere might rely on it.</p>

<h3>Abstraction &amp; its dangers</h3>

<p>Often when designing an API, it's preferable to offer a well defined  public API which will delegate the work to a private implementation shared between  multiple public APIs. This approach avoids duplication, makes maintenance easy, and  allows for more flexibility. As an example, we can have a public  matchmaking API which will delegate most of the work to a private  matchmaking interface. If required, swapping the private interface would be  totally transparent to the public API. This approach has a downside, however. Having a shared private implementation does create a duplication of APIs. It leaves us with both a public and a private API because we need an API for public access and a private API for the public API to connect to. But when we weigh the  benefits and look at what is duplicated, we realize that this trade off  is worth it.</p>

<p>Keeping a certain level of abstraction is important to maintaining the separation of concerns as clear as possible. You want to layer your design so that each  layer is responsible for itself, only knows about itself, and has limited  interactions with other layers. By factoring/isolating the different  modules, you can keep a simple, elegant, easy to maintain system. This  is a key element of design but one needs to be careful not to obfuscate  the design by over abstracting his/her code. This is particularly important when designing a scalable app because you will often need to be able to easily swap parts  to optimize each part of your system.</p>

<p>That said, a lot of code out there is unnecessarily complicated. I sometime wonder if the authors of such code try to show that they know some cool language tricks. Or maybe this is due to the fact that, too often, people are impressed by code they don't understand. The problem with overly complicated or magical code is that it creates yet another abstraction layer between the end user and API. It makes the API more opaque, and that's a cost you have to take into consideration. Every time you abstract something you have a cost associated with the abstraction. This cost can be calculated in terms of performance loss, clarity loss and maintainability cost.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same problem encountered when trying to normalize data in a database.
Normalizing is a great concept which makes a lot of sense ... until you realize that the cost of keeping your data normalized is too great and it becomes a major bottleneck, not letting you scale your application.
At this moment (and probably only then) that you need to denormalize your data.</p>

<p>It's the same thing with code abstraction. It's fine to abstract, unless the abstraction is such that it requires too much work to understand what is going on. A bit of duplication is often worth it, but be careful to not abuse it.</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Ruby has a decent debugger called <a href="http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/ruby-debug.html">ruby-debug</a> and I'm amazed by the amount of people who haven't heard about it.
I don't know what I would do if I couldn't use breakpoints and get an interactive shell to debug Ruby code.
Please people! This is 2011, stop using print statement as a means of debugging!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That's is for this post. It was longer than expected and I feel I didn't really cover anything in depth, but hopefully you learned something new or at least read something that piqued your interest. I look forward to reading your comments and, hopefully, your blog posts sharing your experience in designing scalable software.</p>

    <updated>2011-01-18T08:00:42+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2011/01/18/causality-of-scalability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part of my job at <a href="http://us.playstation.com/">Sony PlayStation</a> is to architect scalable systems which can handle a horde of excited players eager to be the first to play the latest awesome game and who would play for 14-24 hours straight. In other words, I need to make sure a system can "scale". In my case, a scalable system is a system that can go from a few hundred concurrent users/players to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users/players and stay stable for months.</p>

<p>One can achieve scalability in many ways, and if you expect me to provide you with a magical formula you will be disappointed. I actually believe that you can scale almost anything if you have the adequate resources. So saying that X or Y doesn't scale is for me a sign that people are taking shortcuts in their explanations (X or Y are really hard to scale so they don't scale) or that they don't understand the causality of scaling. However what I am exploring in this post is the relationship between cause and effect when trying to make a system scalable. We will see that the scalability challenge is not new and not exclusive to the tech world. We will study the traditional approach to scaling and as well as the challenge of scaling in relation to the web and what to be aware of when planning to make a solution scalable.</p>

<h2>Scaling outside of the tech world</h2>

<p>Trying to scale isn't new. It goes back to well before technology was invented. Scaling something up or increasing something in size or number is a goal businesses have aimed for ever since the oldest profession in the world was invented. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/EN_BESKYTTERINDE_AF_INDUSTRIEN.gif/180px-EN_BESKYTTERINDE_AF_INDUSTRIEN.gif" alt="" />A prostitute wanting to scale up her business was limited by her own time and body. She would reach a point where she couldn't take more clients. (Independent contractors surely know what I am talking about!) So a prostitute wanting to scale up would usually become a madam/Mama-san and scale the business by having girls work for her.</p>

<p>Another simple example would be a restaurant. A restaurant can handle up to a certain amount of covers/clients at once, after that, customers have to wait in line. The restaurant example is interesting because you can clearly see that opening a huge restaurant with a capacity of 1,000 covers might not be a good idea. First because the cost of running such a restaurant might be much more than the income generated. But also because even though the restaurant does 1,000 covers at peak time, it doesn't mean that the restaurant will stay that busy during the entire time it's open. So now you have to deal with waiter/waitresses, busboys and other staff who won't have anything to do. As you probably have understood already, scaling a restaurant means that the scaling has to be done in a cost effective manner.  And what's even more interesting is that what we could have thought was the bottleneck (the amount of concurrent covers) can be easily scaled up but it wouldn't provide real scalability. In fact this choice would cascade into other areas of management like staffing and the building size. Often, the scaling solution for restaurants is to open new locations which can result in keeping the lines shorter, targeting new markets and reducing risks since one failing branch won't dramatically affect the others.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Nighthawks.jpg/400px-Nighthawks.jpg" alt="posted by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<h2>Scaling in the traditional tech world</h2>

<p>If you've ever done console development or worked on embedded devices, you know that they are restricted by some key elements. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/PS3Versions.png/220px-PS3Versions.png" alt="posted by Matt Aimonetti" />It can be memory, CPU, hard drive space etc... You have to "cram" as many features as you can into the device, working around the fixed limitations of the hardware. In the console industry, what's interesting to note is that the hardware doesn't change often but people expect than a new game on the same platform will do things better than the previous game, even though the limitations are exactly the same. This is quite a challenging problem because you have to fight against the hardware limitations by optimizing your code to be super efficient. That's exactly the reason why console video game developers manage memory manually instead of relying on a garbage collector. This way they can squeeze every resource they can from the console.</p>

<p>The great advantage of this type of development is that you can reproduce and accurately anticipate issues. The bottlenecks/limitations are well known and immutable! If you find a way around in your lab, you know that the solution will work for everyone. Console video game developers (and to some extent, iOS developers) don't have to wonder how their game will behave if the player has an old graphic card or not enough RAM.</p>

<p>But ever since we started distributing the processing power, scaling technology has become more challenging.</p>

<h2>Scaling on the web</h2>

<p>Scaling a web based solution might actually seem quite like scaling a restaurant, except that you can't easily open multiple locations since the concept of proximity in web browsing isn't really as concrete as in real life. So the solution can't be directly transposed. Most people will only have to scale up by optimizing their code running on one server, or maybe two. That's because their service/app is not, and won't be, generating high traffic. Scaling such systems is common and one can rely on work done in the past decades for good examples of solutions.</p>

<p>However some web apps/games are or will become high traffic. But because every single entrepreneur I've met believes that their solution will be high traffic, they think they need to be able to scale and therefore should be engineered like that from the beginning. (This is, by the way, the reason scalability is a buzzword and you can sell almost anything technical saying that it scales.) The problem with this approach is that people want scalability but don't understand its causality. In other words, they don't understand the relationship between cause and effect related to making a solution scalable.</p>

<p>Basically we can reduce the concept of causality of scalability to something like this: you change a piece of the architecture to handle more traffic, but this part has an effect on other parts that also need to change and the pursuit of scalability almost never ends (just ask Google). <strong>Making a system scalable needs to have well a defined cause and expected effect, otherwise it's a waste</strong>. In other words, the effect of scaling engenders the need for solutions which themselves have complex effects on a lot of aspects of a system. Let's make it clearer by looking at a simple example:</p>

<p><a href="http://merbist.com/2011/01/18/causality-of-scalability/simplestarchitecture/"><img src="http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/simplestarchitecture-300x269.png" alt="Simple Architecture by Matt Aimonetti" /></a>We have an e-commerce website and this website uses a web application with a database to store products and transactions. Your system is made of 1 webserver handling the requests and one database storing the data. Everything goes well until Black Friday, Christmas or Mother's Day arrives and now some customers are complaining that they can't access your website or that it's too slow. This is also sometimes referred to as the digg/slashdot/reddit effect. All of a sudden you have a peak of traffic and your website can't handle it. This is actually a very simple use case, but that's also the only use case most people on the web need to worry about.</p>

<p>The causality of wanting this solution to scale is simple, you want to scale so you can sell more and have happy customers. The effect is that the system needs to become more complex.</p>

<p>To scale such a system, you need to find the root cause of the problem. You might have a few issues, but start by focusing on the main one. In this case, it's more than likely that your webserver (frontend) cannot handle more than x requests/second. Interestingly enough, the amount of reqs/s might not match the result of your load tests. That's probably because you didn't expect the usage pattern that you are seeing, but that's a whole different topic. At this point you need to understand why you can't go above the x reqs/s limit you're hitting. Where is the bottleneck? Is it that your application code is too slow? Is it the database has been brought to its knees? Or maybe the webserver serves as many requests as technically possible but it's still not enough based on the traffic you are getting.</p>

<p>If we stop right here, we can see that the reasons why the solution doesn't scale can be multiple. But what's even more interesting is that the root cause this time depends on the usage pattern and that it is really hard to anticipate all patterns. If we wanted to make this system scale we could do it different ways.</p>

<p>To give you some canned answers, if the bottleneck is that your code is too slow, you should check if the code is slow because of the DB queries made (too many, slow queries etc..). Is it slow because you are doing something complex that can't be easily improved or is it because you are relying on solutions that are known to not support concurrent traffic easily? More than likely, you will end up going for the easy caching approach. By caching some data (full responses, chunk of data, partial responses etc..) you avoid hitting your application layer and therefore can handle more traffic.</p>

<p>If your code is as fast as it can be, then a solution is to add more application servers or to async some processes. But now that means that you need to change the topology of your system, the way you deploy code and the way you route traffic. You will also increase the load on the database by opening more connections and maybe the database will now becoming the new bottleneck. You might also start seeing race conditions and you are certainly increasing the maintenance and complexity aka cost of your system (caching might end up having the same effect depending on the caching solution chosen).</p>

<p>Just looking at these possible causes and the various solutions (we didn't even mention DB replication, sharding, NoSQL etc..), we can clearly see that making a system scalable has some concrete effects on system complexity/maintenance which directly translate in cost increase.</p>

<p>If you are an engineer, you obviously want your system to be super scalable and handle millions of requests per second. But if you are a business person, you want to be realistic and evaluate the causality of not scaling after a certain point and convert that as loss. Then you weigh the cost of not scaling with the cost of "maybe" scaling and you make a decision.</p>

<p>The problem here though is that scaling is a bit like another buzzword: SEO (Search Engine Optimization). A lot of people/solutions will promise scaling capabilities without really understanding the big picture. Simple systems can easily scale up using simple solutions but only up to a certain level. After that, what you need to do to scale becomes so complex than anyone promising you the moon probably doesn't know what they are talking about. If there was a one-size-fits-all, easy solution for scaling, we would all be using it, from your brother for his blog, to Google without forgetting Amazon.</p>

<p><img src="http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/logo_aws.gif" alt="AWS logo posted by Matt Aimonetti" />Speaking of Amazon, I hear a lot of people saying that Amazon AWS services is "THE WAY" (i.e: the only way) to scale your applications. I agree that it's a compelling solution for a lot of cases but it's far from being a silver bullet. Remember that the cause and effect of why you need to scale are probably different than anyone else.</p>

<h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>

<p>Let me give you a very concrete example of where <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS services</a> might<em> not</em> be a good idea: high traffic sites with lots of database writes and low latency.</p>

<p><a href="http://zynga.com">Zynga</a>, the famous social game company behind Farmville, Mafia Wars etc., is using AWS and it seems that they might have found themselves in the same scenario as above<img src="http://www.zynga.com/img/logo.png" alt="" />. And that would be almost correct. Zynga games have huge traffic and they do a ton of DB writes. However I don't think they need low latency since their game clients are browsers and Flash clients and that their games are mainly async so they just need to be able to handle unstable latency. We'll see in a second how they manage to perform on the AWS cloud.</p>

<p>The major problem with AWS when you have a high traffic site is IO: IO reliability, IO latency, IO availability. By IO, I'm referring to network connection (internal/external) and disk access. Put differently, when you design your system and you know you are going to run on AWS, you need to take into consideration that your solution should survive with zero or limited IO because you will more than likely be IO bound. This means that your traditional design won't work because your database hard drive won't be available for 30s or will be totally saturated. You also need to have a super redundant system because you are going to randomly lose machines. Point number one, moving your existing application from a dedicated hosting solution to AWS might not help you scale if you didn't architect to be resilient to bad IO. Simply put, and to only pick one example: if you were expecting your database to be able to always properly write to disk you will have problems.</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="184" caption="Octocat, the GitHub mascot"]<img src="http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/github-logo.png" alt="" />[/caption]</p>

<p>The solution depends on how you want to look at it and where you are at in your project. You can go the <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/2/8/how-farmville-scales-to-harvest-75-million-players-a-month.html">Zynga route and design/redesign your entire architecture to be highly redundant, not rely on disk access</a> (everything is kept in memory and flushed to disk when available) and tolerate a certain % of data loss. Or you can go with the<a href="https://github.com/blog/493-github-is-moving-to-rackspace"> GitHub approach</a><a href="https://github.com/blog/493-github-is-moving-to-rackspace"> and mix dedicated hardware for IO and "cloud" front end servers all on the same network</a>. One solution isn't better than the other, they are just different and depend on your needs. <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://www.zynga.com/">Zynga</a> both need to scale but they have different requirements.</p>

<p>When it comes to scaling, things are not black or white. To stay on the AWS topic, let's take another example: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Earlier today, I was complaining on Twitter that RDS doesn't and probably won't let you use the <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html">MySQL HandlerSocket plugin</a> any time soon, even though it's been released for almost 6 months and used in prod by many. Then someone asked me if using this plugin would offset the scalability cost-saving. The quick and wrong answer  is yes. By using the plugin, you can potentially get rid of your Memcached servers, probably your Redis/MongoDB/CouchDB servers or whatever NoSQL solution you write and just keep the database servers you currently have. You might have to beef up your DB servers a bit but it would certainly be a huge cost reduction and your system would be simpler, easier to maintain and the data would be more consistent. Sounds good right? After all the biggest online social game company designed it and uses it.</p>

<p>The only problem is that RDS is an AWS service and like every AWS service, it suffers from poor IO. So, if you were deciding to not use RDS and run your own MySQL servers with the HandlerSocket plugin, it wouldn't bring you much improvement <em>(1)</em>. Actually, if you are already IO bound, it would make things worse, because you are centralizing your system around the most unreliable part of your architecture. Based on that premise, RDS won't support HandlerSocket because RDS runs on the same AWS architecture and has to deal with the same IO constraints. What's the solution, you might ask? Amazon already went through these scaling problems and they offer a custom, non-relational, data storage solution working around their own issues called SimpleDB. But why would they improve RDS and fix a really hard problem when they already offer an alternative solution? Easy. SimpleDB forces you to redesign your architecture to work with their custom solution and, guess what? You are now locked-in to that vendor!</p>

<p>So the answer is yes, you can offset scalability costs if you don't use AWS or any other providers with bad IO. Now you should look at the cost of moving away from AWS and see if it's worth it. How much of your code and of your system is vendor specific? Is that something you can easily change? The <a href="https://github.com/geemus/fog">fog library</a>, for instance, supports multiple cloud providers. Are you using something similar? Can you transition to that?  Can you easily deploy to another hosting company? (<a href="http://opscode.com/chef">Opscode chef</a> makes that task much easier) But if, for one reason or another, you have to stick with AWS/<other cloud provider>, make sure that the business people in charge understand the consequences and the cost related to that choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>My point is not to tell you to not design a scalable solution, or not to use AWS, or that RDS sucks. My point is to show that making a system scale is hard and has some drastic effects that are not always obvious. There aren't any silver bullet solutions and you need to be really careful about the consequences (and costs) involved with trying to scale. Make sure it's worth it and you have a plan. Define measurable goals for your scalability even though it's really hard, don't try to scale to infinity and beyond, that won't work. Having to redesign later on to handle even more traffic, is a good problem to have, don't over engineer.</p>

<p>Finally, be careful to understand the consequences of your decisions. What seems to be an almost trivial scaling move such as moving your app from dedicated hosting to a specific cloud provider might end up getting you in a vendor lock in situation!</p>
