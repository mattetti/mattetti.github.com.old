    <h1 class="title entry-title">Ruby Developers Don't Scale</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>Wow, it&#8217;s been a while since I blogged. With all the cool kids saying that spending time reading RSS feeds is overrated (see <a href="http://rubyhoedown2008.confreaks.com/08-chris-wanstrath-keynote.html">Defunkt&#8217;s keynote</a> for instance) I even wonder if people will ever read this post!</p>

<p>Anyways, I have been quite busy preparing courses for classes I gave to a bunch a great Engineers at one of the Fortune 100 companies based in San Diego. I was also planning my big vacation trip to Europe and wrapping up few projects.</p>

<p>However, during my exile overseas, I came to the conclusion that <strong>Rubyists don&#8217;t scale</strong>. Since Twitter became stable again, we don&#8217;t hear many people ranting about Rails not scaling anymore.  With one of my clients&#8217; app handling around <strong>7 million requests/day</strong> I can tell you <strong>Ruby/Merb do scale quite well</strong>! But ruby developers don&#8217;t seem to scale for some reason.</p>

<p>Maybe saying that we(Rubyists) don&#8217;t scale isn&#8217;t technically correct but that&#8217;s basically what one of my client told me.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go back in time a little bit and follow my client who we will call clientX.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ClientX has a <strong>great concept</strong> and wants to conquer the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>ClientX hears that <strong>Rails is the way to go</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>ClientX hires a contractor/mercenary/freelancer/guns for hire/<strong>consultant</strong> (aka Me)</p></li>
<li><p>Me builds a <strong>killer app</strong> using <strong>Merb</strong> (killing framework)</p></li>
<li><p>ClientX raises loads of <strong>$$$</strong></p></li>
<li><p>ClientX <strong>wants to hire a team</strong> because Me doesn&#8217;t want to become a FTE</p></li>
<li><p>ClientX and Me <strong>look for Rubyists</strong> wanting to relocate and get a decent salary</p></li>
<li><p>ClientX <em>*can&#8217;t find someone</em> they consider good enough and who would accept their package</p></li>
<li><p>Many <strong>JAVA guys are available</strong> on location and accept lower packages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ruby app gets ported over to JAVA</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Me sad</strong> :(</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So is it really the Rubyists&#8217; fault if we don&#8217;t want to relocate and only accept higher packages? Should I blame <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/">Obie</a> for telling people to charge more and teaching how to <a href="http://rubyhoedown2008.confreaks.com/07-obie-fernandez-do-the-hustle.html">hustle</a>? Or should we just tell clients that it&#8217;s time to get used to working remotely?</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t think any of the above explanations are valid. Ruby is the new/hot technology and very few people have the skills and experience to lead major projects. These people make a good living and enjoy their &#8220;freedom&#8221; and dream of building their own products. Most of them/us value their work environment, family and are reluctant to move.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080827-rwca7tfprhce6hw19uytfqx1bc.jpg" alt="scale" /></p>

<p>At the same time, companies do need people locally(at least a core team) and can&#8217;t always afford the cool kids.</p>

<p>ClientX, quite frustrated by the whole hiring process told me once: <strong>&#8220;you Ruby folks are too unavailable and difficult to work with! We need a committed team that actually cares about the company/product.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>That hurts when you worked hard on a project and just can&#8217;t satisfy the client by finding guys willing to relocate and work for them. <strong>It gets even more painful when your code gets entirely ported over to JAVA!</strong></p>

<p>But at the same time I understand ClientX&#8217;s motivation, PHP guys are cheaper, JAVA guys are more available, why in the word did we go with Ruby and are now struggling finding people?</p>

<p>Once again, there is positive and negative side in everything, by choosing Ruby and a &#8220;great contractor&#8221; ClientX was able to <strong>catch up with the competition and even pass them in no time</strong>. They quickly raised good money and got everything they needed to become #1. I don&#8217;t believe it would have been possible to do the same thing so quickly with JAVA for instance. However choosing a cutting edge technology means you need to look harder for talented people.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s too bad the code gets rewritten in a different language but at the same time, I do my best to facilitate the process and to keep a good relation with my client. There was nothing personal in the decision, it&#8217;s just too bad we were not able to keep on using the latest/coolest/awesomess technology available :)</p>

<h2>To finish on a positive note, here is the solution to scale your Ruby task force provided to you by the #caboose wisdom:</h2>

<p>Based on my conversations with other #caboosers who hire other devs, the word in the street is that you just need to get one or two great ruby guys (who will probably cost you a lot) and find a bunch of smart people to train. You&#8217;ll end up with an awesome team of scalable rubyists ;)</p>
