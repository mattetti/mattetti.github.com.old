    <h1 class="title entry-title">Speed Up Your Rails XML Responses</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>At <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/">work</a>, we have an XML API that gets quite a lot of traffic. Last week I looked into improving its performance since we are expecting more traffic soon and want to make sure our response time is optimized.</p>

<p>My first thought was to make sure we had  an optimized <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/XmlMini.html">ActiveSupport&#8217;s xmlmini backend</a>. Rails 2.3.5 fixed some issues when using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> as a xmlmini so I switched to my favorite Ruby XML lib:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend = 'Nokogiri'
</code></pre>

<p>I run some benchmarks using ab, httperf and jmeter but the results were not that great. I was so sure that switching from <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/index.html">rexml</a> to <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">nokogiri</a> would give me awesome results that I was very disappointed.</p>

<p>I was about to call <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/">Aaron Patterson</a> (Nokogiri&#8217;s author) to insult him, blame him for _why&#8217;s disappearance and tell him that all his pro bono efforts were useless since my own app was not running much faster when switched to his library. As I was about to dial his number on my iPhone I had a crazy thought&#8230; maybe it was not Aaron&#8217;s fault, maybe it was mine.</p>

<p>So I took a break went to play some fuzzball and as I was being ridiculed by Italian coworker, Emanuele, I realized that most of our API calls were just simple HTTP requests with no XML payload, just some query params. However, we were generating a lot of XML to send back to the client and AS::XmlMini only takes care of the XML parsing, not the rendering.</p>

<p>The XML rendering is done by <a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a>&#8217;s pure Ruby <a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org/">builder library</a> which is vendored in Rails. Builder does a good job, but I thought that maybe a C based library might improve the speed. A coworker of mine (James Bunch) recommended to look into <a href="http://github.com/codahale/faster-builder">faster-builder</a>, a drop-in Builder replacement based on libxml. Unfortunately, the project doesn&#8217;t seem to be maintained and I decided to look into using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> XML builder instead. (Also, faster-builder&#8217;s author doesn&#8217;t like me very much while Aaron knows he&#8217;s one of my Ruby heroes so asking for help could be easier)</p>

<p>Some people reported having tried using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> as a XML builder but didn&#8217;t see much speed improvement. Because of the amount of magic required to render a rxml template, I was not really surprised but I decided to contact Aaron and ask him if he tried using his lib instead of builder in a Rails app. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronp/57241193/">Aaron</a> told me he gave it a try a while back and he helped me get my Rails app setup to render xml templates using <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a>.</p>

<p>The next step was simple, create a <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/noko-vs-builder-benchmark">benchmark app</a> and benchmark Builder vs Nokogiri using various templates. Here are the results I got using Ruby 1.9.1 (the Ruby version we use in production) and two sets of templates:</p>

<p><strong>Builder</strong> small template, <strong>time per request: 15.507 [ms]</strong> (mean)</p>

<p>Running the benchmarks many times showed that Nokogiri and Builder were taking more or less the same amount of time to builder a small template.</p>

<p>I then decided to try a bigger template, closer to what we have in production, here are the results:</p>

<p><strong>Nokogiri</strong> longer template, <strong>time per request: 31.252 [ms] (mean)</strong></p>

<p>Wow, <a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a>&#8217;s Nokogori just brought us a<strong> 4.5X speed improvement for this specific template</strong>.  100ms per request is probably not a big deal for most people and I have to say that Jim did a great job with Builder. However in my specific case, 100ms on a request being called thousands of times per hour is quite important.</p>

<p>(The <a href="http://github.com/mattetti/noko-vs-builder-benchmark">benchmark app is available on github</a>, feel free to fork it and benchmark your own templates)</p>

<p>Who would have thought that a man like this could save the day?!</p>
