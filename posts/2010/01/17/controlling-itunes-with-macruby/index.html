    <h1 class="title entry-title">Controlling iTunes With MacRuby</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>Since Mac OS X v10.5, Apple added a technology called Scripting Bridge which allows to control and communicate with scriptable applications such as Mail, iChat or iTunes.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/12/31/im-new-year-count-down-with-macruby/">I showed how to control iChat</a> with MacRuby. This time I&#8217;m going to show you how to control iTunes.</p>

<p>Here is a small script that I wrote to wake me up in music every morning.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/macruby
framework 'Foundation'
framework 'ScriptingBridge'

itunes = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier("com.apple.itunes")
load_bridge_support_file 'iTunes.bridgesupport'
itunes.run

class SBElementArray
  def [](value)
    self.objectWithName(value)
  end
end

itunes.stop
playlist = itunes.sources["Library"].userPlaylists["morning"]
playlist.playOnce(false) if playlist
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that I have a Mac Mini streaming music through speakers connected to an AirportExpress in my bedroom.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go through the script quickly.</p>

<p>We start by loading two frameworks, Foundation and ScriptingBridge.
Now that we have ScriptingBridge loaded, we can control iTunes. To do that, we use:
SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier(&#8220;com.apple.itunes&#8221;)
We then load a bridgesupport file that contains the enumerated constants from the iTunes scriptable dictionary.</p>

<p>We make sure iTunes is running by calling #run on the application object.</p>

<p>Before using iTune scriptable interface, we are making the API a bit nicer, it&#8217;s totally unnecessary but it makes our code look better.</p>

<p>itunes.sources returns an instance of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Reference/SBElementArray_Class/SBElementArray/SBElementArray.html">SBElementArray</a> which is not really an array nor a hash.</p>

<p>The rest of the code is pretty simple, we find the library, find the playlist called &#8216;morning&#8217; and play it if found.</p>

<p>So you might wonder two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the iTunes.bridgesupport file?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know what methods are available to control iTunes?</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>bridgesupport file</h4>

<p>The bridgesupport file is important since it defines the required constants.
Apple provides a metadata generator called gen_bridge_metadata which generates a bridgesupport file.</p>

<p>Here is what the documentation says:</p>

<pre><code>$ man gen_bridge_metadata




NAME
gen_bridge_metadata -- Objective-C Bridges Metadata Generator

SYNOPSIS
gen_bridge_metadata [options...] headers...

DESCRIPTION
gen_bridge_metadata is a tool that generates bridging metadata information for a given framework or set of head-
ers. The Objective-C bridges supported in Mac OS X, such as RubyCocoa (Ruby) and PyObjC (Python), read this
information at runtime.

Metadata files describe the parts of an Objective-C framework that the bridges cannot automatically handle. These
are primarily the ANSI C elements of the framework -- functions, constants, enumerations, and so on -- but also
include special cases such as functions or methods that accept pointer-like arguments. These special cases must
be manually specified in separate files called exceptions. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can then read in the
exceptions file when it generates the framework metadata.

The file extension used for metadata files should be .bridgesupport.

Certain elements, such as inline functions, cannot be described in the metadata files. It is therefore required
to generate a dynamic library in order to make the bridges use them. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can take care
of that for you.

The file extension for the dynamic libraries should be .dylib.

You should install metadata files in one of three filesystem locations. For example, for a framework named
MyFramework that is installed as /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework.framework, you can install the
MyFramework.bridgesupport and MyFramework.dylib files in one of the following possible locations, in order of
priority:

o   /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework/Resources/BridgeSupport

o   /Library/BridgeSupport

o   ~/Library/BridgeSupport
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that we don&#8217;t have a framework or header file to generate a bridgesupport file for.
So, what we need a header file for iTunes, turns out we have a tool to do that:</p>

<pre><code>$ sdef /Applications/iTunes.app | sdp -fh --basename iTunes
</code></pre>

<p>I won&#8217;t go in the details of what sdef and sdp do, just check their manual page.
Running the command above will create a iTunes.h which we can use to create a bridgesupport file.
Here is the generated header file: http://gist.github.com/279657</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s create a bidgesupport file:</p>

<pre><code>$ gen_bridge_metadata -c '-I.' iTunes.h &gt; iTunes.bridgesupport
</code></pre>

<p>An that&#8217;s how we get the bridgesupport file. (see file: <a href="http://gist.github.com/279698">http://gist.github.com/279698</a>)</p>

<h4>iTunes Documentation</h4>

<p>The easiest way to understand what&#8217;s available to you is to open iTunes&#8217; dictionary in the AppleScript Editor.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100118-fe5c3224jd8xfhciwqxpy4hptc.jpg" alt="iTunes API by Matt Aimonetti" /></p>

<p>Otherwise you can study the iTunes.h file.</p>

<p>I wrote a very dumb parser to give you an idea of the methods and properties available when controlling iTunes via ScriptingBridge, here is the  output:</p>
