[DrNic](http://drnicwilliams.com/) the most famous Australian Rails developer surprisingly doesn’t spend most of his time working on Rails  [read interview](http://www.akitaonrails.com/pages/drnic)
That’s maybe why he recently became so active in the Rails community ( see [Magic Multi-Connections](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000610.html), Magic Models, map_by_methods, Gem Generator etc..)





Today he released something very helpful for the Rails Community, not another Gem or another cool plugin to extend Rails but a [web application](http://myconfplan.com) to help you planning your conferences. We already had other tools such as [conference meetup](http://railsconf2007.conferencemeetup.com/p/276-matt-aimonetti) but it’s the first time that we get a product helping you to plan a conference by scheduling the sessions you want to attend.

I had a quick chat with DrNic about his latest creation and here is what he said:





“its been fun building just how I thought session selection might look + feel
web2.0 = permissive voyeurism I think!”





I share the same vision than Nic on session selection and I really enjoyed booking my Rails sessions and seeing what other people selected. (I guess that’s my voyeur side, don’t you like web2.0?)





If you wanna see what I planned on attending, checkout my schedule: [my schedule](http://myconfplan.com/conferences/RailsConf2007/users/matt)





Thanks Nic for the good work and too bad you are not presenting anything at the RailsConf (move your bum to come up with a _better_ submission next year!)
